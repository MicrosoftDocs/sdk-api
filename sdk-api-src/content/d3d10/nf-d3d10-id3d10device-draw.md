# ID3D10Device::Draw


## -description


Draw non-indexed, non-instanced primitives.


## -parameters




### -param VertexCount [in]

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT</a></b>

Number of vertices to draw.


### -param StartVertexLocation [in]

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT</a></b>

Index of the first vertex, which is usually an offset in a vertex buffer; it could also be used as the first vertex id generated for a shader parameter marked with the <b>SV_TargetId</b> <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-semantics">system-value semantic</a>.


## -remarks



A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d11/d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-input-assembler-stage-getting-started">draw API</a> submits work to the rendering pipeline.

The vertex data for a draw call normally comes from a vertex buffer that is bound to the pipeline. However, you could also provide the vertex data from a shader that has vertex data marked with the <b>SV_VertexId</b> <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-semantics">system-value semantic</a>.
