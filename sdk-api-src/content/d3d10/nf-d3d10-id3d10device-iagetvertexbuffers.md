# ID3D10Device::IAGetVertexBuffers


## -description

Get the <a href="/windows/desktop/direct3d10/d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-resources-types">vertex buffers</a> bound to the <a href="/windows/desktop/direct3d11/d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-input-assembler-stage">input-assembler</a> stage.

## -parameters

### -param StartSlot [in]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT</a></b>

The <a href="/windows/desktop/direct3d11/d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-input-assembler-stage-getting-started">input slot</a> of the first vertex buffer to get. The first vertex buffer is explicitly bound to the start slot; this causes each additional vertex buffer in the array to be implicitly bound to each subsequent input slot. A maximum of 16 or 32 input slots (ranges from 0 to either D3D10_IA_VERTEX_INPUT_RESOURCE_SLOT_COUNT - 1 or D3D10_1_IA_VERTEX_INPUT_RESOURCE_SLOT_COUNT - 1) are available; the <a href="/windows/desktop/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-devices-downlevel-intro">maximum number of input slots depends on the feature level</a>.

### -param NumBuffers [in]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT</a></b>

The number of vertex buffers to get starting at the offset. The number of buffers (plus the starting slot) cannot exceed the total number of IA-stage input slots.

### -param ppVertexBuffers [out]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d10/nn-d3d10-id3d10buffer">ID3D10Buffer</a>**</b>

A pointer to an array of vertex buffers returned by the method (see <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d10/nn-d3d10-id3d10buffer">ID3D10Buffer</a>).

### -param pStrides [out]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT</a>*</b>

Pointer to an array of stride values returned by the method; one stride value for each buffer in the vertex-buffer array. Each stride value is the size (in bytes) of the elements that are to be used from that vertex buffer.

### -param pOffsets [out]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT</a>*</b>

Pointer to an array of offset values returned by the method; one offset value for each buffer in the vertex-buffer array. Each offset is the number of bytes between the first element of a vertex buffer and the first element that will be used.

## -remarks

Any returned interfaces will have their reference count incremented by one. Applications should call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-release">IUnknown::Release</a> on the returned interfaces when they are no longer needed to avoid memory leaks.
