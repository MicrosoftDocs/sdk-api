# ID3D10Device::DrawInstanced


## -description

Draw non-indexed, instanced primitives.

## -parameters

### -param VertexCountPerInstance [in]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT</a></b>

Number of vertices to draw.

### -param InstanceCount [in]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT</a></b>

Number of instances to draw.

### -param StartVertexLocation [in]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT</a></b>

Index of the first vertex.

### -param StartInstanceLocation [in]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT</a></b>

Index of the first instance.

## -remarks

A <a href="/windows/desktop/direct3d11/d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-input-assembler-stage-getting-started">draw API</a> submits work to the rendering pipeline.

Instancing may extend performance by reusing the same geometry to draw multiple objects in a scene. One example of instancing could be to draw the same object with different positions and colors. For an example of instancing, see the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Ee416415(v=VS.85).aspx">Instancing10 Sample</a>.

The vertex data for an instanced draw call normally comes from a vertex buffer that is bound to the pipeline. However, you could also provide the vertex data from a shader that has instanced data identified with a <a href="/windows/desktop/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-semantics">system-value semantic</a> (SV_InstanceID).
