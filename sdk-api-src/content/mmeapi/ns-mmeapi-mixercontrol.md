# MIXERCONTROL structure


## -description

The <b>MIXERCONTROL</b> structure describes the state and metrics of a single control for an audio line.

## -struct-fields

### -field cbStruct

Size, in bytes, of the <b>MIXERCONTROL</b> structure.

### -field dwControlID

Audio mixer-defined identifier that uniquely refers to the control described by the <b>MIXERCONTROL</b> structure. This identifier can be in any format supported by the mixer device. An application should use this identifier only as an abstract handle. No two controls for a single mixer device can ever have the same control identifier.

### -field dwControlType

Class of the control for which the identifier is specified in <b>dwControlID</b>. An application must use this information to display the appropriate control for input from the user. An application can also display tailored graphics based on the control class or search for a particular control class on a specific line. If an application does not know about a control class, this control must be ignored. There are eight control class classifications, each with one or more standard control types:

### -field fdwControl

Status and support flags for the audio line control. The following values are defined:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLF_DISABLED"></a><a id="mixercontrol_controlf_disabled"></a><dl>
<dt><b>MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLF_DISABLED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The control is disabled, perhaps due to other settings for the mixer hardware, and cannot be used. An application can read current settings from a disabled control, but it cannot apply settings.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLF_MULTIPLE"></a><a id="mixercontrol_controlf_multiple"></a><dl>
<dt><b>MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLF_MULTIPLE</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The control has two or more settings per channel. An equalizer, for example, requires this flag because each frequency band can be set to a different value. An equalizer that affects both channels of a stereo line in a uniform fashion will also specify the MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLF_UNIFORM flag.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLF_UNIFORM"></a><a id="mixercontrol_controlf_uniform"></a><dl>
<dt><b>MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLF_UNIFORM</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The control acts on all channels of a multichannel line in a uniform fashion. For example, a control that mutes both channels of a stereo line would set this flag. Most MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLTYPE_MUX and MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLTYPE_MIXER controls also specify the MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLF_UNIFORM flag.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### -field cMultipleItems

Number of items per channel that make up a MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLF_MULTIPLE control. This number is always two or greater for multiple-item controls. If the control is not a multiple-item control, do not use this member; it will be zero.

### -field szShortName

Short string that describes the audio line control specified by <b>dwControlID</b>. This description should be appropriate to use as a concise label for the control.

### -field szName

String that describes the audio line control specified by <b>dwControlID</b>. This description should be appropriate to use as a complete description for the control.

### -field Bounds

Union of boundary types.

### -field Bounds.DUMMYSTRUCTNAME

### -field Bounds.DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.lMinimum

Minimum signed value for a control that has a signed boundary nature. This member cannot be used in conjunction with <b>dwMinimum</b>.

### -field Bounds.DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.lMaximum

Maximum signed value for a control that has a signed boundary nature. This member cannot be used in conjunction with <b>dwMaximum</b>.

### -field Bounds.DUMMYSTRUCTNAME2

### -field Bounds.DUMMYSTRUCTNAME2.dwMinimum

Minimum unsigned value for a control that has an unsigned boundary nature. This member cannot be used in conjunction with <b>lMinimum</b>.

### -field Bounds.DUMMYSTRUCTNAME2.dwMaximum

Maximum unsigned value for a control that has an unsigned boundary nature. This member cannot be used in conjunction with <b>lMaximum</b>.

### -field Bounds.dwReserved

Reserved; do not use.

### -field Metrics

Union of boundary metrics.

### -field Metrics.cSteps

Number of discrete ranges within the union specified for a control specified by the <b>Bounds</b> member. This member overlaps with the other members of the <b>Metrics</b> structure member and cannot be used in conjunction with those members.

### -field Metrics.cbCustomData

Size, in bytes, required to contain the state of a custom control class. This member is appropriate only for the MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLTYPE_CUSTOM control class.

### -field Metrics.dwReserved

Reserved; do not use.
