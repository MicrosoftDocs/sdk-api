# IPAddrEntry structure


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[This structure may be altered or unavailable in future versions of Windows.]

Implements part of the Management Information Base (MIB-II) 
			information group for the Internet Protocol (IP) as specified in the 
			Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comments <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2011.txt">(RFC) 2011</a>.


## -struct-fields




### -field iae_addr

An IPv4 IP address to which this structure pertains.


### -field iae_index

The index value that uniquely identifies the interface associated with this
					IP address.


### -field iae_mask

The subnet mask associated with this IP address. The value of the mask is an 
					IPv4 address with all the network bits set to 1 and all the hosts bits set to 0.


### -field iae_bcastaddr

The value of the least-significant bit in the IP broadcast address used for 
					sending datagrams on the logical interface associated with this IP address. 
					For example, when the Internet standard all-ones broadcast address 
					is used, the value is 1. This value applies to both the subnet and network 
					broadcast addresses used by the entity on this logical interface.


### -field iae_reasmsize

The size of the largest IP datagram that this entity can reassemble from 
					incoming IP fragmented datagrams received on this interface.


### -field iae_context

A context value for this IP address.


### -field iae_pad

A pad value.
