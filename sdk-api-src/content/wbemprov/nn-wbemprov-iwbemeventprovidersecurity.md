# IWbemEventProviderSecurity interface


## -description

The 
<b>IWbemEventProviderSecurity</b> interface is optionally implemented by event providers who want to restrict consumer access to their event. For more information about when to use this interface, see <a href="/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/securing-wmi-events">Securing WMI Events</a>.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IWbemEventProviderSecurity</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IWbemEventProviderSecurity</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

This method is automatically called by Windows Management whenever a new consumer attempts to subscribe to an event where the event provider has implemented 
<b>IWbemEventProviderSecurity</b>. If the consumer has access permission for the event the consumer is subscribed to the event; otherwise, the subscription is denied.
