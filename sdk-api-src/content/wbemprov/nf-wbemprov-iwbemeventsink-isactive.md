## -description


The 
<b>IWbemEventSink::IsActive</b> method is used by the provider to determine if there is interest in the events that the sink is filtering. In the case of a restricted sink, these events are defined by the queries passed to

In the case where it is not a restricted sink, these events are defined by the queries in the event provider's registration. In the latter, the sink is always active.
