# TraceLoggingWriteStart macro

## -description

Starts an activity and logs the start event.

The activity must not have already been started.

## -parameters

### -param activity [in]

The activity to start.

### -param name [in]

The name of the event. This must be a string literal and not a variable. It
cannot have any embedded nul characters.

#### - args [in, optional]

Additional parameters added to the event. The maximum number of optional
parameters is 99. All parameters must be wrapper macros as defined in
[TraceLogging Wrapper Macros](/windows/win32/tracelogging/tracelogging-wrapper-macros).

The args should not include **TraceLoggingLevel**, **TraceLoggingKeyword**, or
**TraceLoggingOpcode**. The level and keyword are set on the activity itself,
and the opcode for a start event is always "Start".
