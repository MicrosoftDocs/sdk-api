# ITfCleanupContextDurationSink::OnEndCleanupContext


## -description

Called when a context cleanup operation completes.

## -parameters

## -returns

If this method succeeds, it returns **S_OK**. Otherwise, it returns an **HRESULT** error code.

## -remarks

A context cleanup occurs when:

- The text service is deactivated while a context is still on the context stack. This can occur when the active text service is changed or when the active language changes while the text service is active.
- [ITfThreadMgr::Deactivate](nf-msctf-itfthreadmgr-deactivate.md) is called while a context is still on the context stack.

[ITfCleanupContextDurationSink::OnStartCleanupContext](nf-msctf-itfcleanupcontextdurationsink-onstartcleanupcontext.md) is called just before the TSF manager begins making [ITfCleanupContextSink::OnCleanupContext](nf-msctf-itfcleanupcontextsink-oncleanupcontext.md) notifications. When all of the OnCleanupContext notifications complete, the TSF manager calls **OnEndCleanupContext**.
