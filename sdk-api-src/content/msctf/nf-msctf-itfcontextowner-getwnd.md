# ITfContextOwner::GetWnd


## -description


The <b>ITfContextOwner::GetWnd</b> method returns the handle to a window that corresponds to the current document.


## -parameters




### -param phwnd [out]

Receives a pointer to the handle of the window that corresponds to the current document. This parameter can be <b>NULL</b> if the document does not have the corresponding handle to the window.


## -returns

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method was successful.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



A document might not have a corresponding window handle if the document is in memory but not displayed on the screen or if the document is a windowless control and the control does not know the window handle of the owner of the windowless controls. Callers cannot assume that the <i>phwnd</i> parameter will receive a non-<b>NULL</b> value even if the method is successful. Callers can also receive a <b>NULL</b> value for the <i>phwnd</i> parameter.
