# ITfCompartment interface


## -description

The <b>ITfCompartment</b> interface is implemented by the TSF manager and is used by clients (applications and text services) to obtain and set data in a TSF compartment.

A client also uses this interface to obtain an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/msctf/nn-msctf-itfsource">ITfSource</a> interface that is used to install an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/msctf/nn-msctf-itfcompartmenteventsink">ITfCompartmentEventSink</a> compartment change notification sink. The client calls <b>ITfCompartment::QueryInterface</b> with IID_ITfSource to obtain the <b>ITfSource</b> interface.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">ITfCompartment</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>ITfCompartment</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
