# ITfCompartment interface


## -description


The <b>ITfCompartment</b> interface is implemented by the TSF manager and is used by clients (applications and text services) to obtain and set data in a TSF compartment.

A client also uses this interface to obtain an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/msctf/nn-msctf-itfsource">ITfSource</a> interface that is used to install an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/msctf/nn-msctf-itfcompartmenteventsink">ITfCompartmentEventSink</a> compartment change notification sink. The client calls <b>ITfCompartment::QueryInterface</b> with IID_ITfSource to obtain the <b>ITfSource</b> interface.
