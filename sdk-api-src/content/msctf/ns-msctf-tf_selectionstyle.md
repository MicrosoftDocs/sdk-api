# TF_SELECTIONSTYLE structure


## -description



The <b>TF_SELECTIONSTYLE</b> structure represents the style of a selection.




## -struct-fields




### -field ase

Specifies the active end of the selection. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/msctf/ne-msctf-tfactiveselend">TfActiveSelEnd</a>.


### -field fInterimChar

Indicates if the selection is an interim character. If this value is nonzero, then the seleciton is an interim character and <b>ase</b> will be TF_AE_NONE. If this value is zero, the selection is not an interim character.


## -remarks



An interim character selection spans exactly one character and is visually represented as a solid rectangle that is usually flashing. This is a standard UI element of Korean and some Chinese character compositions. <b>fInterimChar</b> is an indication that a specific character is composed. <b>fInterimChar</b> can only be nonzero for a single selection. In this case, there will be no caret because the highlight replaces it.
