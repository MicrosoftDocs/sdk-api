## -remarks



This method is provided as a convenience to the application developer. Associating the focus for a window with a document manager causes the TSF manager to automatically call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/msctf/nf-msctf-itfthreadmgr-setfocus">ITfThreadMgr::SetFocus</a> with the associated document manager when the associated window receives the focus.

This method can only associate a single window with a single document manager. If the implementation associates multiple document managers with a single window, or the opposite, the implementation must call <b>ITfThreadMgr::SetFocus</b> to set the focus to the proper document manager.

To restore the previous focus association, call this method with the same window handle and the value returned in the original call <i>ppdimPrev</i> for <i>pdimNew</i>. The following is an example.


```cpp

//associate the focus for m_hwnd with m_pDocMgr 
pThreadMgr->AssociateFocus(m_hwnd, m_pDocMgr, &m_pPrevDocMgr);



//Restore the original focus association. 
ITfDocumentMgr *pTempDocMgr = NULL;

pThreadMgr->AssociateFocus(m_hwnd, m_pPrevDocMgr, &pTempDocMgr);

if(pTempDocMgr)
{
    pTempDocMgr->Release();
}
    
if(m_pPrevDocMgr)
{
    m_pPrevDocMgr->Release();
}

```
