# WlxNegotiate function


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[The WlxNegotiate function is no longer available for use as of Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista.]

The <b>WlxNegotiate</b> function must be implemented by a replacement <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/g-gly">GINA</a> DLL. This is the first call made by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/w-gly">Winlogon</a> to the GINA DLL. <b>WlxNegotiate</b> allows the GINA to verify that it supports the installed version of Winlogon.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>   GINA DLLs are ignored in Windows Vista.</div><div> </div>

## -parameters




### -param dwWinlogonVersion [in]

Specifies which version of Winlogon will be communicating with the GINA.


### -param pdwDllVersion [out]

Indicates which version of Winlogon the GINA supports. This version information is also used by Winlogon to determine which dispatch table is passed to the GINA in subsequent calls to 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winwlx/nf-winwlx-wlxinitialize">WlxInitialize</a>. This version cannot be greater than the version specified by <i>dwWinLogonVersion</i>.


## -returns



If the Winlogon version specified by <i>dwWinLogonVersion</i> is greater than or equal to the version returned in <i>pdwDllVersion</i>, the function returns <b>TRUE</b>. When <b>TRUE</b> is returned, Winlogon will continue to initialize.

If <i>dwWinLogonVersion</i> is less than <i>pdwDllVersion</i>, the function returns <b>FALSE</b>. When <b>FALSE</b> is returned, Winlogon will terminate and the system will not boot.




## -remarks



Before calling <b>WlxNegotiate</b>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/w-gly">Winlogon</a> sets the desktop state so that the current desktop is the Winlogon desktop and sets the workstation state so that the desktop is locked.
