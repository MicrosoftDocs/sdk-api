# IInkEdit::get_MousePointer


## -description

Gets or sets a value indicating the type of mouse pointer to be displayed.

This property is read/write.

## -parameters

## -remarks

If you set the <b>MousePointer</b> property to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/msinkaut/ne-msinkaut-inkmousepointer">IMP_Default</a>, the mouse cursor setting is based on the current cursor's drawing attributes. If the ink collector is disabled, the mouse cursor setting is based on the underlying windows mouse cursor <a href="/windows/desktop/api/inked/nf-inked-iinkedit-get_drawingattributes">DrawingAttributes</a> property. If the <b>MousePointer</b> property is set to <b>IMP_Custom</b> and the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/inked/nf-inked-iinkedit-get_mouseicon">MouseIcon</a> property is <b>NULL</b>, then the ink collector no longer handles mouse cursor settings. Setting the mouse cursor to any other setting (other than the <b>MousePointer</b> property set to <b>IMP_Default</b> and the <b>MouseIcon</b> property set to <b>NULL</b>) forces the mouse cursor to use the current setting.

You can use this property when you want to indicate changes in functionality as the mouse pointer passes over controls on a form or dialog box. The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/msinkaut/ne-msinkaut-inkmousepointer">IMP_Hourglass</a> setting is useful for indicating that the user should wait for a process or operation to finish.
