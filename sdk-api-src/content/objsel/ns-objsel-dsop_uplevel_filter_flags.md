# DSOP_UPLEVEL_FILTER_FLAGS structure


## -description

The <b>DSOP_UPLEVEL_FILTER_FLAGS</b> structure contains flags that indicate the filters to use for an up-level scope. An up-level scope is a scope that supports the ADSI LDAP provider. For more information, see 
<a href="/windows/desktop/ADSI/adsi-ldap-provider">ADSI LDAP Provider</a>. This structure is contained in the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/objsel/ns-objsel-dsop_filter_flags">DSOP_FILTER_FLAGS</a> structure when calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/objsel/nf-objsel-idsobjectpicker-initialize">IDsObjectPicker::Initialize</a>.

## -struct-fields

### -field flBothModes

Filter flags to use for an up-level scope, regardless of whether it is a mixed or native mode domain. This member can be a combination of one or more of the following flags.



#### DSOP_FILTER_INCLUDE_ADVANCED_VIEW (1 (0x1))

Includes objects that have the <a href="/windows/desktop/ADSchema/a-showinadvancedviewonly">showInAdvancedViewOnly</a> attribute set to <b>TRUE</b>.

Includes <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/winmessenger/im-imsgrsession-user-property">user</a> objects.



#### DSOP_FILTER_BUILTIN_GROUPS (4 (0x4))

Includes built-in <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/axe/group">group</a> objects. Built-in groups are group objects with a <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/mscs/groups-grouptype">groupType</a> value that contain the <b>GROUP_TYPE_BUILTIN_LOCAL_GROUP</b> (0x00000001), <b>GROUP_TYPE_RESOURCE_GROUP</b> (0x00000004), and <b>GROUP_TYPE_SECURITY_ENABLED</b> (0x80000000) flags.



#### DSOP_FILTER_WELL_KNOWN_PRINCIPALS (8 (0x8))

Includes the contents of the Well Known Security Principals container.



#### DSOP_FILTER_UNIVERSAL_GROUPS_DL (16 (0x10))

Includes distribution <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/axe/group">group</a> objects with universal scope.



#### DSOP_FILTER_UNIVERSAL_GROUPS_SE (32 (0x20))

Includes security groups with universal scope. This flag has no affect in a mixed mode domain because universal security groups do not exist in mixed mode domains.



#### DSOP_FILTER_GLOBAL_GROUPS_DL (64 (0x40))

Includes distribution <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/axe/group">group</a> objects with global scope.



#### DSOP_FILTER_GLOBAL_GROUPS_SE (128 (0x80))

Includes security <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/axe/group">group</a> objects with global scope.



#### DSOP_FILTER_DOMAIN_LOCAL_GROUPS_DL (256 (0x100))

Includes distribution <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/axe/group">group</a> objects with domain local scope.



#### DSOP_FILTER_DOMAIN_LOCAL_GROUPS_SE (512 (0x200))

#### DSOP_FILTER_CONTACTS (1024 (0x400))

### -field flMixedModeOnly

Filter flags to use for an up-level domain in mixed mode. Mixed mode refers to an up-level domain that may have Windows NT 4.0 Backup Domain Controllers present. This member can be a combination of the flags listed in the <b>flBothModes</b> flags. The <b>DSOP_FILTER_UNIVERSAL_GROUPS_SE</b> flag has no affect in a mixed-mode domain because universal security groups do not exist in mixed mode domains.

### -field flNativeModeOnly

Filter flags to use for an up-level domain in native mode. Native mode refers to an up-level domain in which an administrator has enabled native mode operation. This member can be a combination of the flags listed in the <b>flBothModes</b> flags.

## -remarks

For more information about domain modes, see <a href="/windows/desktop/AD/detecting-the-operation-mode-of-a-domain">Detecting the Operation Mode of a Domain</a>.
