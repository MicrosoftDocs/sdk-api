The <b>DSOP_FILTER_FLAGS</b> structure contains flags that indicate the types of objects presented to the user for a specified scope or scopes. This structure is contained in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objsel/ns-objsel-dsop_scope_init_info">DSOP_SCOPE_INIT_INFO</a> structure when calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objsel/nf-objsel-idsobjectpicker-initialize">IDsObjectPicker::Initialize</a>.
