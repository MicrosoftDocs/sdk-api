# DiUninstallDriverW function


## -description

The <b>DiUninstallDriver</b> function removes a driver from any devices it is installed on by installing those devices with another matching driver, if available, or the null driver if no other matching driver is available. Then the specified driver is removed from the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/install/driver-store">driver store.</a>

## -parameters

### -param hwndParent [in, optional]

A handle to the top-level window that <b>DiUninstallDriver</b> should use to display any user interface component that is associated with uninstalling the driver. This parameter is optional and can be set to <b>NULL</b>.

### -param InfPath [in]

A pointer to a NULL-terminated string that supplies the fully qualified path of the INF file for the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/install/driver-packages">driver package</a>.

### -param Flags [in]

A value of type DWORD that specifies zero or one or more of the following flags: DIURFLAG_NO_REMOVE_INF. Typically, this flag should be set to zero. 

If this flag is zero, <b>DiUninstallDriver</b> only uninstalls the specified driver from a device if the driver is a better match for a device than the driver that is currently installed on a device. However, if this flag is set to DIURFLAG_NO_REMOVE_INF, <b>DiUninstallDriver</b> removes the driver package from any devices it is installed on, but does not remove the drive package from the Driver Store.

<div class="alert"><b>Caution:</b>  Forcing the uninstallation of the driver can result in replacing a more compatible or newer driver with a less compatible or older driver. </div>
<div> </div>
For information about how Windows selects a driver for a device, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/install/how-setup-selects-drivers">How Windows Selects Drivers</a>.

### -param NeedReboot [out, optional]

A pointer to a value of type BOOL that <b>DiUninstallDriver</b> sets to indicate whether a system restart is required to complete the uninstallation. This parameter is optional and can be <b>NULL</b>. If the parameter is supplied and a system restart is required to complete the uninstallation, <b>DiUninstallDriver</b> sets the value to <b>TRUE</b>. In this case, the caller must prompt the user to restart the system. If this parameter is supplied and a system restart is not required to complete the uninstallation, <b>DiUninstallDriver</b> sets the value to <b>FALSE</b>. If the parameter is <b>NULL</b> and a system restart is required to complete the uninstallation, <b>DiUninstallDriver</b> displays a system restart dialog box. For more information about this parameter, see the following <b>Remarks</b> section.

## -returns

<b>DiUninstallDriver</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the function successfully removes the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/install/driver-packages">driver package</a> from any devices it is installed on and is successfully removed from the driver store of the system. If the driver package is not successfully uninstalled from the driver store, <b>DiUninstallDriver</b> returns <b>FALSE</b> and the logged error can be retrieved by making a call to <b>GetLastError</b>. Some of the more common error values that <b>GetLastError</b> might return are as follows:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The caller does not have Administrator privileges. By default, Windows requires that the caller have Administrator privileges to uninstall a <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/install/driver-packages">driver package</a> from the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/install/driver-store">driver store</a>. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">

<td width="60%">

The calling application is a 32-bit application that is attempting to execute in a 64-bit environment, which is not allowed. For more information, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/install/device-installations-on-64-bit-systems">Installing Devices on 64-Bit Systems</a>.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## -remarks

In general, an uninstallation application should set <i>NeedReboot</i> to <b>NULL</b> to direct <b>DiUninstallDriver</b> to prompt the user to restart the system if a restart is required to complete the removal. An application should supply a <i>NeedReboot</i> pointer only in the following cases:

<ul>
<li>
The application must call <b>DiUninstallDriver</b> several times to complete an uninstallation. In this case, the application should record whether a <b>TRUE</b> <i>NeedReboot</i> value is returned by any of the calls to <b>DiUninstallDriver</b> and, if so, prompt the user to restart the system after the final call to <b>DiUninstallDriver</b> returns.

</li>
<li>
The application must perform required operations, other than calling <b>DiUninstallDriver</b>, before a system restart should occur. If a system restart is required, the application should finish the required operations and then prompt the user to restart the system. 

</li>

</ul>
