# ICertExit2 interface


## -description

The <b>ICertExit2</b> interface is one of two interfaces that   provide communications between  the Certificate Services server and an exit module.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The exit module can communicate with the Certificate Services server by using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certif/nn-certif-icertserverexit">ICertServerExit</a> interface.</div><div> </div>The Certificate Services server calls the <b>ICertExit2</b> methods to perform the following tasks:<ul>
<li>Initialize the Certificate Services server.</li>
<li>Notify the exit module of an event such as certificate issuance, <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">CRL</a> issuance, or server shutdown, has occurred.</li>
<li>Retrieve a description of the exit module.</li>
<li>Retrieve the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certmod/nn-certmod-icertmanagemodule">ICertManageModule</a> interface implemented by the exit module. The methods of this interface allows the Certificate Services server to configure the exit module as well as set and retrieve the exit module properties.</li>
</ul>


<b>ICertExit2</b> is defined in Certexit.h. When you create your program, however, use Certsrv.h as the include file.

Certificate Services interfaces support both apartment-threading and free-threading models. For better throughput, free threading is recommended.
