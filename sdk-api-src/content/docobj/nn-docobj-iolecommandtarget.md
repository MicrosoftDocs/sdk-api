# IOleCommandTarget interface


## -description


Enables objects and their containers to dispatch commands to each other. For example, an object's toolbars may contain buttons for commands such as <b>Print</b>, <b>Print Preview</b>, <b>Save</b>, <b>New</b>, and <b>Zoom</b>.

Normal in-place activation guidelines recommend that you remove or disable such buttons because no efficient, standard mechanism has been available to dispatch them to the container. Similarly, a container has heretofore had no efficient means to send commands such as <b>Print</b>, <b>Page Setup</b>, and <b>Properties</b> to an in-place active object. Such simple command routing could have been handled through existing OLE Automation standards and the <b>IDispatch</b> interface, but the overhead with IDispatch is more than is required in the case of document objects. The <b>IOleCommandTarget</b> interface provides a simpler means to achieve the same ends.

Available commands are defined by integer identifiers in a group. The group itself is identified with a GUID. The interface allows a caller both to query for support of one or more commands within a group and to issue a supported command to the object.
