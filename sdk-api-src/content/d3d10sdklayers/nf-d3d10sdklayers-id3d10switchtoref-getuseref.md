# ID3D10SwitchToRef::GetUseRef


## -description


Get a boolean value that indicates the type of device being used.


## -parameters






## -returns



Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">BOOL</a></b>

<b>TRUE</b> if the device is a software device, <b>FALSE</b> if the device is a hardware device. See remarks.




## -remarks



A hardware device is commonly referred to as a HAL device, which stands for a hardware accelerated device. This means that the pipeline is rendering all of the pipeline commands in hardware, using the GPU. Operating the pipeline with a HAL device gives the best performance generally, but it can be more difficult to debug since resources exist on the GPU instead of the CPU.

A software device implements rendering in software using the CPU with no hardware acceleration. A software device is commonly referred to as a reference device or REF device. Because a REF device implements rendering on the CPU, it is generally slower, but is easier to debug since it allows access to resources.
