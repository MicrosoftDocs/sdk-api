# CRL_DIST_POINT_NAME structure


## -description


The <b>CRL_DIST_POINT_NAME</b> structure identifies a location from which the CRL can be obtained. When <b>CRL_DIST_POINT_NAME</b> is used, different forms of the CRL distribution point name appear in the <b>FullName</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_alt_name_info">CERT_ALT_NAME_INFO</a> structure. An application need not be able to process all of the name forms in the structure. It can use a distribution point if at least one name form can be processed.

If no name forms for a distribution point can be processed, an application can still use the certificate, provided requisite revocation information can be obtained from another source such as a distribution point of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">certification authority's</a> (CA's) directory entry.
