# CERT_AUTHORITY_INFO_ACCESS structure


## -description


The <b>CERT_AUTHORITY_INFO_ACCESS</b> structure represents authority information access and subject information access certificate extensions and specifies how to access additional information and services for the subject or the issuer of a certificate.


## -struct-fields




### -field cAccDescr

The number of elements in the <b>rgAccDescr</b> array.


### -field rgAccDescr

An array of pointers to 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_access_description">CERT_ACCESS_DESCRIPTION</a> structures that describes the format and location of additional information about the certificate. Each <b>CERT_ACCESS_DESCRIPTION</b> structure has as its members a <b>pszAccessMethod</b> string that indicates an access method and a 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_alt_name_entry">CERT_ALT_NAME_ENTRY</a> structure that indicates the location of the additional information.


## -remarks



The type of information represented by this structure depends on the access methods specified by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_access_description">CERT_ACCESS_DESCRIPTION</a> structures in the <i>rgAccDescr</i> array. For more information about access methods, the authority information access extension, and the subject information access extension, see <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt">RFC 3280</a>.

The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptdecodeobject">CryptDecodeObject</a> function creates an instance of this structure when decoding a 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_extension">CERT_EXTENSION</a> structure's <b>Value</b> member and the <b>pszObjId</b> member of the <b>CERT_EXTENSION</b> structure is set to szOID_AUTHORITY_INFO_ACCESS or szOID_SUBJECT_INFO_ACCESS.

An instance of this structure can be used as input to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptencodeobject">CryptEncodeObject</a> function to create an appropriate <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_extension">CERT_EXTENSION</a>.
