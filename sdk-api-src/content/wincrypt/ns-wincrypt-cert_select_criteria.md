# CERT_SELECT_CRITERIA structure


## -description


The <b>CERT_SELECT_CRITERIA</b> structure specifies selection criteria that is passed to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-certselectcertificatechains">CertSelectCertificateChains</a> function.


## -struct-fields




### -field dwType

Specifies the type of selection criteria used for the <b>ppPara</b> member. This member can have one of the following values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="CERT_SELECT_BY_ENHKEY_USAGE"></a><a id="cert_select_by_enhkey_usage"></a><dl>
<dt><b>CERT_SELECT_BY_ENHKEY_USAGE</b></dt>
<dt>1</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Select certificates  based on  a specific <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/e-gly">enhanced key usage</a>. When this flag is set, the <i>ppPara</i> must reference a null-terminated <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/o-gly">object identifier</a> (OID) ANSI string that specifies the enhanced key usage.

This criteria is evaluated on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">certificate</a>.

</td>

<td width="40%"><a id="CERT_SELECT_BY_KEY_USAGE"></a><a id="cert_select_by_key_usage"></a><dl>
<dt><b>CERT_SELECT_BY_KEY_USAGE</b></dt>
<dt>2</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Select certificates  based on  a specific <b>szOID_KEY_USAGE</b> extension in the certificate.  When this flag is set, the <b>ppPara </b> member must reference a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_extension">CERT_EXTENSION</a> structure where the value of the extension is a <b>DWORD</b> that identifies the Key Usage bits.

This criteria is evaluated on the certificate.

</td>

<dt><b>CERT_SELECT_BY_POLICY_OID</b></dt>
<dt>3</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Select certificates based on a specific issuance policy. The <b>ppPara</b> member must reference a null-terminated OID ANSI string of the desired issuance policy.

This criteria is evaluated on the issuance policy of the certificate chain.

</td>

</td>
<td width="60%">
Select certificates based on the presence of a specified extension and an optional specified value. The <b>ppPara</b> member must reference a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_extension">CERT_EXTENSION</a> structure that specifies the extension OID and the  associated value.

<dt>6</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Select certificates based on the Subject DNS HOST Name. The <b>ppPara</b> member must reference a null-terminated Unicode string that contains the subject host name. The selection performed based on this flag  is the same as the evaluation of the <b>pwszServerName</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-httpspolicycallbackdata">SSL_EXTRA_CERT_CHAIN_POLICY_PARA</a> structure during a call to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-certverifycertificatechainpolicy">CertVerifyCertificateChainPolicy</a> function.

### -field cPara

A <b>DWORD</b> value that specifies the number of search attributes specified in the <b>ppPara</b> member. 


### -field ppPara

A pointer to a pointer to one or more selection values.  The data type depends on the selection type specified by the <b>dwType</b> member. If more than one selection value is present, an application must match only one value.
