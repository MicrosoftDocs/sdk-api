# CRYPT_TIMESTAMP_ACCURACY structure


## -description


The <b>CRYPT_TIMESTAMP_ACCURACY</b> structure is used by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-crypt_timestamp_info">CRYPT_TIMESTAMP_INFO</a> structure to represent the accuracy of the time deviation around the UTC time at which the time stamp token was created by the Time Stamp Authority (TSA).


## -struct-fields




### -field dwSeconds

Optional. Specifies, in seconds, the accuracy of the upper limit of the time at which the time stamp token was created by the TSA.


### -field dwMillis

Optional. Specifies, in milliseconds, the accuracy of the upper limit of the time at which the time stamp token was  created by the TSA.


### -field dwMicros

Optional. Specifies, in microseconds, the accuracy of the upper limit of the time at which the time-stamp token was created by the TSA.
