# CERT_BASIC_CONSTRAINTS2_INFO structure


## -description


The <b>CERT_BASIC_CONSTRAINTS2_INFO</b> structure contains information indicating whether the certified subject can act as a CA or an end entity. If the subject can act as a CA, a certification path length constraint can also be specified.


<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptdecodeobject">CryptDecodeObject</a> creates an instance of this structure when performed on a 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_extension">CERT_EXTENSION</a> structure's <b>Value</b> member with the structure's <b>pszObjId</b> member set to szOID_BASIC_CONSTRAINTS2.

An instance of this structure can be used as input to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptencodeobject">CryptEncodeObject</a> to create an appropriate <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_extension">CERT_EXTENSION</a>.


## -struct-fields




### -field fCA

Boolean indicating whether the certificate subject can act as a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">certification authority</a> (CA) or not.


### -field fPathLenConstraint

Boolean indicating whether the <b>dwPathLenConstraint</b> field limits the maximum length of the certification path. Used only if <b>fCA</b> is <b>TRUE</b>.


### -field dwPathLenConstraint

Maximum number of CA certificates that can follow this certificate in a certification path. A value of zero indicates that the subject of this certificate can issue certificates only to end entities and not to other CAs. Used only if both <b>fCA</b> and <b>fPathLenConstraint</b> are <b>TRUE</b>.
