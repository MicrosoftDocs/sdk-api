# CTL_USAGE_MATCH structure


## -description


The <b>CTL_USAGE_MATCH</b> structure provides parameters for finding <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">certificate trust lists</a> (CTL) used to build a certificate chain.


## -struct-fields




### -field dwType

Determines the kind of issuer matching to be done. In <b>AND</b> logic, the certificate must meet all criteria. In <b>OR</b> logic, the certificate must meet at least one of the criteria. The following codes are defined to determine the logic used in the match.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="USAGE_MATCH_TYPE_AND"></a><a id="usage_match_type_and"></a><dl>
<dt><b>USAGE_MATCH_TYPE_AND</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
<b>AND</b> logic

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="USAGE_MATCH_TYPE_OR"></a><a id="usage_match_type_or"></a><dl>
<dt><b>USAGE_MATCH_TYPE_OR</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
<b>OR</b> logic

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

Default usage match logic is USAGE_MATCH_TYPE_AND.


### -field Usage


<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-ctl_usage">CTL_USAGE</a> structure that includes an array of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/o-gly">object identifiers</a> (OIDs) a CTL must match in order to be valid.
