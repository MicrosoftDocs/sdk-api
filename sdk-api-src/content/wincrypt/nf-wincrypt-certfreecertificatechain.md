# CertFreeCertificateChain function


## -description


The <b>CertFreeCertificateChain</b> function frees a certificate chain by reducing its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/r-gly">reference count</a>. If the reference count becomes zero, memory allocated for the chain is released.

To free a context obtained by a get, duplicate, or create function, call the appropriate free function.  To free a context obtained by a find or enumerate function, either pass it in   as the previous context parameter to a subsequent invocation of the function, or call the appropriate free function.  For more information, see the  reference topic for the function that obtains the context.


## -parameters




### -param pChainContext [in]

A pointer to a 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_chain_context">CERT_CHAIN_CONTEXT</a> certificate chain context to be freed. If the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/r-gly">reference count</a> on the context reaches zero, the storage allocated for the context is freed.
