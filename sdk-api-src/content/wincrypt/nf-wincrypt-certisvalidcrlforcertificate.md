# CertIsValidCRLForCertificate function


## -description


The <b>CertIsValidCRLForCertificate</b> function checks a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">CRL</a> to find out if it is a CRL that would include a specific certificate if that certificate were revoked. If the CRL has an issuing distribution point (IDP) extension, the function checks whether that IDP is valid for the certificate being checked.


## -parameters




### -param pCert [in]

A pointer to a certificate <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">context</a>.


### -param pCrl [in]

A pointer to a CRL. The function checks this CRL to determine whether it could contain the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">certificate context</a> pointed to by <i>pCert</i>. The function does not look for the certificate in the CRL.


### -param dwFlags [in]

Currently not used and must be set to zero.


### -param pvReserved [in]

Currently not used and must be set to <b>NULL</b>.


## -returns



The function returns <b>TRUE</b> if the CRL is a valid CRL to be searched for the specific certificate. It returns <b>FALSE</b> if the CRL is not a valid CRL for searching for the certificate.




## -remarks



For the CRL to be valid for the certificate, the <b>CertIsValidCRLForCertificate</b> function does not require the CRL to be issued by the same <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">certification authority</a> (CA) as the issuer of the certificate.
