# _DEV_BROADCAST_USERDEFINED structure


## -description


Contains the user-defined event and optional data associated with the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/DevIO/dbt-userdefined">DBT_USERDEFINED</a> device event.


## -struct-fields




### -field dbud_dbh

Information about the device affected by a 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/DevIO/wm-devicechange">WM_DEVICECHANGE</a> message as specified by the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dbt/ns-dbt-dev_broadcast_hdr">DEV_BROADCAST_HDR</a> structure. Because 
<b>_DEV_BROADCAST_USERDEFINED</b> is variable length, the <b>dbch_size</b> member of the <b>dbud_dbh</b> structure must be the size in bytes of the entire structure, including the variable length portion.


### -field dbud_szName

A pointer to a case-sensitive, null-terminated string that names the message. The string must consist of the vendor name, a backslash, followed by arbitrary user-defined null-terminated text.


## -remarks



Because this structure contains variable length fields, use it as a template for creating a pointer to a user-defined structure. Note that the structure must not contain pointers. The following example shows such a user-defined structure.


```cpp
#define NAME_LENGTH 32 
#define USER_LENGTH 50 
 
typedef struct tagWIDGET_WARE_DEV_BROADCAST_USERDEFINED
{
    struct _DEV_BROADCAST_HDR DBHeader; 
    char   szName[NAME_LENGTH];
    BYTE   UserDefined[USER_LENGTH]; 
} WIDGET_WARE_DEV_BROADCAST_USERDEFINED;
```
