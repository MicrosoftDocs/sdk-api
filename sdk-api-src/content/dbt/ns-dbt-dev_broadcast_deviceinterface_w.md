# DEV_BROADCAST_DEVICEINTERFACE_W structure


## -description

Contains information about a class of devices.

## -struct-fields

### -field dbcc_size

The size of this structure, in bytes. This is the size of the members plus the actual length of the 
      <b>dbcc_name</b> string (the null character is accounted for by the declaration of 
      <b>dbcc_name</b> as a one-character array.)

### -field dbcc_devicetype

Set to <b>DBT_DEVTYP_DEVICEINTERFACE</b>.

### -field dbcc_reserved

Reserved; do not use.

### -field dbcc_classguid

The GUID for the interface device class.

### -field dbcc_name

A null-terminated string that specifies the name of the device.

When this structure is returned to a window through the 
       <a href="/windows/desktop/DevIO/wm-devicechange">WM_DEVICECHANGE</a> message, the 
       <b>dbcc_name</b> string is converted to ANSI as appropriate. Services always receive a 
       Unicode string, whether they call 
       <b>RegisterDeviceNotificationW</b> 
       or 
       <b>RegisterDeviceNotificationA</b>.

## -remarks

> [!NOTE]
> The dbt.h header defines DEV_BROADCAST_DEVICEINTERFACE as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
