# INetworkCostManagerEvents::CostChanged


## -description


The <b>CostChanged</b> method is called to indicates a cost change for either machine-wide Internet connectivity, or the first-hop of routing to a specific destination on a connection.


## -parameters




### -param newCost [in]

A DWORD that represents the new cost of the connection. The lowest 16 bits represent the cost level, and the highest 16 bits represent the flags. Possible values are defined by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/netlistmgr/ne-netlistmgr-nlm_connection_cost">NLM_CONNECTION_COST</a> enumeration.


### -param pDestAddr [in]

An <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/netlistmgr/ns-netlistmgr-nlm_sockaddr">NLM_SOCKADDR</a> structure containing an IPv4/IPv6 address that identifies the destination on which the event occurred. If <i>destAddr</i> is NULL, the change is a machine-wide Internet connectivity change.


## -returns



Returns S_OK on success.
