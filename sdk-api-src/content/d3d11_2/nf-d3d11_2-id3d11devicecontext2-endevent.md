# ID3D11DeviceContext2::EndEvent


## -description

Allows applications to annotate the end of a range of graphics commands.

## -parameters

## -remarks

<b>EndEvent</b> allows applications to annotate the end of a range of graphics commands, in order to provide more context to what the GPU is executing. When the appropriate <a href="/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-3.0/ms751538(v=vs.85)">ETW</a> logging is not enabled, this method does nothing. When ETW logging is enabled, an additional marker is correlated between the CPU and GPU timelines.
