# ISensOnNow::BatteryLow


## -description


The 
<b>BatteryLow</b> method notifies an application that battery power is low. SENS calls the <b>BatteryLow</b> method to notify an application that a computer is using battery power. 

Low battery power is signaled when a system is on battery power and the battery is low according to the same logic used by the Advanced Power Management (APM) event PBT_APMBATTERYLOW. This event is broadcast when a system APM BIOS sends an APM battery low notification.

Some APM BIOS implementations do not provide notifications when batteries are low, which means that this event may never be broadcast on some computers.


## -parameters




### -param dwBatteryLifePercent [in]

The percent of battery power that remains.


## -returns
