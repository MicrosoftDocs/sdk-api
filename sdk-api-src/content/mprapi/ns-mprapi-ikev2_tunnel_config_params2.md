# IKEV2_TUNNEL_CONFIG_PARAMS2 structure


## -description


Gets or sets tunnel parameters for Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) devices.

Do not use the <b>IKEV2_TUNNEL_CONFIG_PARAMS2</b> structure directly in your code; using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/RRAS/router-management-data-types">IKEV2_TUNNEL_CONFIG_PARAMS</a> instead ensures that the proper version, based on the operating system the code in compiled under, is used.


## -struct-fields




### -field dwIdleTimeout

A value that specifies the time, in seconds, after which the connection will be disconnected if there is no traffic.


### -field dwNetworkBlackoutTime

A value that specifies the retransmission timeout for IKEv2 request packets. IKEv2 expects a response for every request packet sent, this value specifies the time after which the connection is deleted in case a response is not received.


### -field dwSaLifeTime

A value that specifies the lifetime, in seconds, of a security association (SA), after which the SA is no longer valid.


### -field dwSaDataSizeForRenegotiation

A value that specifies the number of kilobytes that are allowed to be transferred using a SA before it must be renegotiated.


### -field dwConfigOptions

Not implemented. Must be set to 0.


### -field dwTotalCertificates

A value that specifies the number of certificates in <b>certificateNames</b>.


### -field certificateNames

An array of CERT_NAME_BLOB structures that contain X.509 public key infrastructure certificates.


### -field machineCertificateName

The encryption type to be used for IKEv2.


### -field dwEncryptionType

A value that  that specifies the encryption type to be negotiated during  the SA negotiation for the IKE2 tunnel based VPN connections. The <i>dwEncryptionType</i> parameter must have one of the following values.

</table>
 


### -field customPolicy

A value that specifies the custom IKEv2 configurations to be used during  the SA negotiation. If <b>customPolicy</b> is set to <b>NULL</b>, no custom IKEv2 configuration is available.
