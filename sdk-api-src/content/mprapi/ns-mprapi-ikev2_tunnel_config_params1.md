# IKEV2_TUNNEL_CONFIG_PARAMS1 structure


## -description


Used to get or set tunnel parameters for Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) devices.

Do not use the <b>IKEV2_TUNNEL_CONFIG_PARAMS1</b> structure directly in your code; using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/RRAS/router-management-data-types">IKEV2_TUNNEL_CONFIG_PARAMS</a> instead ensures that the proper version, based on the operating system the code in compiled under, is used.

### -field dwSaLifeTime

A value that specifies the lifetime, in seconds, of a security association (SA), after which the SA is no longer valid.


### -field dwSaDataSizeForRenegotiation

A value that specifies the number of kilobytes that are allowed to be transferred using a SA before it must be renegotiated.


### -field dwConfigOptions

Not implemented. Must be set to 0.


### -field dwTotalCertificates

A value that specifies the number of certificates in the <b>certificateNames</b> member.


### -field certificateNames

An array of CERT_NAME_BLOB structures that contain X.509 public key infrastructure certificates.
