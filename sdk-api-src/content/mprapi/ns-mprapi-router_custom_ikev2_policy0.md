# ROUTER_CUSTOM_IKEv2_POLICY0 structure


## -description

Contains the IKEv2 main mode and quick mode policy configuration.

Do not use the  <b>ROUTER_CUSTOM_IKEv2_POLICY0</b> structure directly in your code; using <a href="/windows/desktop/RRAS/router-management-data-types">ROUTER_CUSTOM_IKEv2_POLICY</a> instead ensures that the proper version, based on the operating system the code in compiled under, is used.

## -struct-fields

### -field dwIntegrityMethod

A value that specifies the integrity algorithm to be negotiated during IKEv2 main mode SA negotiation. The allowed values for this member are defined in [IKEEXT_INTEGRITY_TYPE](/windows/desktop/api/iketypes/ne-iketypes-ikeext_integrity_type).

### -field dwEncryptionMethod

A value that specifies the encryption algorithm to be negotiated during IKEv2 main mode SA negotiation. The allowed valued for this member are defined in [IKEEXT_CIPHER_TYPE](/windows/desktop/api/iketypes/ne-iketypes-ikeext_cipher_type).

### -field dwCipherTransformConstant

A value that specifies the encryption algorithm to be negotiated during IKEv2 quick mode SA negotiation. The allowed valued for this member are defined in [IPSEC_CIPHER_TYPE](/windows/desktop/api/ipsectypes/ne-ipsectypes-ipsec_cipher_type).

### -field dwAuthTransformConstant

A value that specifies the hash algorithm to be negotiated during IKEv2 quick mode SA negotiation. The allowed valued for this member are defined in [IPSEC_AUTH_TYPE](/windows/desktop/api/ipsectypes/ne-ipsectypes-ipsec_auth_type).

### -field dwPfsGroup

A value that specifies the Diffie Hellman algorithm that should be used for Quick Mode PFS (Perfect Forward Secrecy). The allowed valued for this member are defined in [IPSEC_PFS_GROUP](/windows/desktop/api/ipsectypes/ne-ipsectypes-ipsec_pfs_group).

### -field dwDhGroup

A value that specifies the type of Diffie Hellman group used for Internet Key Exchange (IKE) key generation during MM SA negotiation. The allowed valued for this member are defined in [IKEEXT_DH_GROUP](/windows/desktop/api/iketypes/ne-iketypes-ikeext_dh_group).
