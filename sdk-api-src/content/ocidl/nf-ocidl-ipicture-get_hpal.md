## -remarks



<h3><a id="Notes_to_Callers"></a><a id="notes_to_callers"></a><a id="NOTES_TO_CALLERS"></a>Notes to Callers</h3>
If the picture object has ownership of the picture, it also has ownership of the palette and will destroy it when the object is itself destroyed. Otherwise the caller owns the palette. The <i>fOwn</i> parameter to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/olectl/nf-olectl-olecreatepictureindirect">OleCreatePictureIndirect</a> determines ownership. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/olectl/nf-olectl-oleloadpicture">OleLoadPicture</a> sets <i>fOwn</i> to <b>TRUE</b> to indicate that the picture object owns the palette.
