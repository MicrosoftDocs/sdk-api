# IViewObjectEx::QueryHitRect


## -description


Indicates whether any point in a rectangle is within a given drawing aspect of an object.


## -parameters




### -param dwAspect [in]

The requested drawing aspect.


### -param pRectBounds [in]

An object bounding rectangle in client coordinates of the containing window. This rectangle is computed and passed by the container so that the object can meaningfully interpret the hit location.


### -param pRectLoc [in]

The hit test rectangle, specified in <b>HIMETRIC</b> units, relative to the top-left corner of the object.


### -param lCloseHint [in]

The suggested distance, in <b>HIMETRIC</b> units, that the container considers close. This value is a hint, and objects can interpret it in their own way. Objects can also use this hint to roughly infer output resolution to choose expansiveness of hit test implementation.


### -param pHitResult [out]

A pointer to returned information about the hit expressed as the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/ne-ocidl-hitresult">HITRESULT</a> enumeration values.


## -returns



This method returns S_OK on success. Other possible return values include the following.

<td width="60%">
This method is not implemented for the requested aspect. Use DVASPECT_CONTENT instead.

</table>
 




## -remarks



Containers may need to test whether an object overlaps a given drawing aspect of another object. They can determine whether the objects overlap by requesting a region or at least a bounding rectangle of the aspect in question. However, a quicker way to do this is to call <b>IViewObjectEx::QueryHitRect</b> to ask the object whether a given rectangle intersects one of its drawing aspects.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Unlike <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nf-ocidl-iviewobjectex-queryhitpoint">IViewObjectEx::QueryHitPoint</a>, this method does not return HITRESULT_TRANSPARENT or HITRESULT_CLOSE. It is strictly hit or miss, returning HITRESULT_OUTSIDE if no point in the rectangle is hit and HITRESULT_HIT if at least one point in the rectangle is a hit.</div>

<h3><a id="Notes_to_Implementers"></a><a id="notes_to_implementers"></a><a id="NOTES_TO_IMPLEMENTERS"></a>Notes to Implementers</h3>
An object supporting <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nn-ocidl-iviewobjectex">IViewObjectEx</a> is required to implement this method at least for the DVASPECT_CONTENT aspect. The object should not take any other action in response to this method other than to return the information; there should be no side-effects. If there is any ambiguity about whether a point is a hit, for instance due to coordinates not converting exactly, the object should return HITRESULT_HIT whenever any point in the rectangle might be a hit on the object. That is, it is permissible to claim a hit for a point that is not actually rendered, but never correct to claim a miss for any point that is in the rendered image of the object.
