# IOleUndoManager::Close


## -description


Closes the specified parent undo unit.


## -parameters




### -param pPUU [in]

A pointer to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nn-ocidl-ioleparentundounit">IOleParentUndoUnit</a> interface for the currently open parent unit to be closed.


### -param fCommit [in]

Indicates whether to keep or discard the unit. If <b>TRUE</b>, the unit is kept in the collection. If <b>FALSE</b>, the unit is discarded. This parameter is used to allow the client to discard an undo unit under construction if an error or a cancellation occurs.


## -returns



This method returns S_OK if the undo manager had an open parent undo unit and it was successfully closed. If the undo manager is disabled, it should immediately return S_OK and do nothing else. Other possible return values include the following.

<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_FALSE</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The parent undo unit did not have an open child and it was successfully closed.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_INVALIDARG</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
If <i>pPUU</i> does not match the currently open parent undo unit, then implementations of this method should return E_INVALIDARG without changing any internal state unless the parent unit is blocked.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



This method is implemented the same as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nf-ocidl-ioleparentundounit-close">IOleParentUndoUnit::Close</a>. A parent undo unit knows it is being closed when it returns S_FALSE from this method. At that time, it should terminate any communication with other objects which may be giving data to it through private interfaces.

<h3><a id="Notes_to_Callers"></a><a id="notes_to_callers"></a><a id="NOTES_TO_CALLERS"></a>Notes to Callers</h3>
An error return indicates a fatal error condition.

The parent unit or undo manager must accept the undo unit if <i>fCommit</i> is <b>TRUE</b>.

<h3><a id="Note_to_Implementers"></a><a id="note_to_implementers"></a><a id="NOTE_TO_IMPLEMENTERS"></a>Note to Implementers</h3>
To process a close request, a parent undo unit first checks to see if it has an open child unit. If it does not, it returns S_FALSE.

If it does have a child unit open, it calls the <b>IOleUndoManager::Close</b> method on the child. If the child returns S_FALSE, then the parent undo unit verifies that <i>pPUU</i> points to the child unit, and closes that child undo unit. If the child returns S_OK then it handled the close internally and its parent should do nothing.

If the parent unit is blocked, it should check the <i>pPUU</i> parameter to determine the appropriate return code. If <i>pPUU</i> is pointing to itself, then it should return S_FALSE.

Otherwise, it should return S_OK; the <i>fCommit</i> parameter is ignored; and no action is taken.

If <i>pPUU</i> does not match the currently open parent undo unit, then implementations of this method should return E_INVALIDARG without changing any internal state. The only exception to this is if the unit is blocked.
