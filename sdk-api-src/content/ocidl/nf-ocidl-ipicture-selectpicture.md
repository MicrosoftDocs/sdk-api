# IPicture::SelectPicture

Selects a bitmap picture into a given device context, and returns the device context in which the picture was previously selected as well as the picture's GDI handle. This method works in conjunction with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nf-ocidl-ipicture-get_curdc">IPicture::get_CurDC</a>.


## -parameters




### -param hDCIn [in]

A handle for the device context in which to select the picture.


### -param phDCOut [out]

A pointer to a variable that receives the previous device context. This parameter can be <b>NULL</b> if the caller does not need this information. Ownership of the device context is always the responsibility of the caller.


### -param phBmpOut [out]

A pointer to a variable that receives the GDI handle of the picture. This parameter can be <b>NULL</b> if the caller does not need the handle. Ownership of this handle is determined by the <i>fOwn</i> parameter passed to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/olectl/nf-olectl-olecreatepictureindirect">OleCreatePictureIndirect</a>. Pictures loaded from a stream always own their resources.
