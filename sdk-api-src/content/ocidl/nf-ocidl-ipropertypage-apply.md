# IPropertyPage::Apply


## -description

Applies the current values to the underlying objects associated with the property page as previously passed to 
    <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nf-ocidl-ipropertypage-setobjects">IPropertyPage::SetObjects</a>.

## -parameters

## -returns

This method can return the standard return values <b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b> and 
      <b>E_UNEXPECTED</b>, as well as the following values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Changes were successfully applied and the property page is current with the underlying objects.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_FALSE</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Changes were applied, but the property page cannot determine if its state is current with the 
        objects.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## -remarks

The objects to be changed are provided through a previous call to 
     <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nf-ocidl-ipropertypage-setobjects">IPropertyPage::SetObjects</a>. By calling 
     <b>IPropertyPage::SetObjects</b> prior to calling this 
     method, the caller ensures that all underlying objects have the correct interfaces through which to communicate 
     changes. Therefore, this method should not fail because of non-existent interfaces.

After applying its values, the property page should determine if its state is now current with the objects in 
     order to properly implement 
     <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nf-ocidl-ipropertypage-ispagedirty">IPropertyPage::IsPageDirty</a> and to provide both 
     <b>S_OK</b> and <b>S_FALSE</b> return values.

E_NOTIMPL is not a valid return value.
