# IOleControl::FreezeEvents


## -description


Indicates whether the container is ignoring or accepting events from the control.


## -parameters




### -param bFreeze [in]

Indicates whether the container will ignore (<b>TRUE</b>) or now process (<b>FALSE</b>) events from the control.


## -returns



This method returns S_OK in all cases.




## -remarks



The control is not required to stop sending events when <i>bFreeze</i> is <b>TRUE</b>. However, the container is not going to process them in this case. If a control depends on the container's processing -- as with request events that return information from the container -- the control must either discard the event or queue the event to send later when <i>bFreeze</i> is <b>FALSE</b>.

<h3><a id="Notes_to_Implementers"></a><a id="notes_to_implementers"></a><a id="NOTES_TO_IMPLEMENTERS"></a>Notes to Implementers</h3>
As with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nf-ocidl-iolecontrol-onambientpropertychange">IOleControl::OnAmbientPropertyChange</a>, S_OK is returned in all cases in order to prevent a container from making assumptions about a control's behavior based on return values.
