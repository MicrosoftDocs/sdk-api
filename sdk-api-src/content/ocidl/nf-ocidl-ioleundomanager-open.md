# IOleUndoManager::Open


## -description


Opens a new parent undo unit, which becomes part of its containing unit's undo stack.


## -parameters




### -param pPUU [in]

An <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nn-ocidl-ioleparentundounit">IOleParentUndoUnit</a> pointer to the parent undo unit to be opened.


## -returns



This method returns S_OK if the parent undo unit was successfully opened or if a currently open unit is blocked. If the undo manager is currently disabled, it will return S_OK and do nothing else.




## -remarks



This method is implemented the same as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nf-ocidl-ioleparentundounit-open">IOleParentUndoUnit::Open</a>. The specified parent unit is created and remains open. The undo manager then calls the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nf-ocidl-ioleundomanager-add">IOleUndoManager::Add</a> or <b>IOleUndoManager::Open</b> methods on this parent unit to add new units to it. This parent unit receives any additional undo units until its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nf-ocidl-ioleundomanager-close">IOleUndoManager::Close</a> method is called.

The parent unit specified by <i>pPUU</i> is not added to the undo stack until its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nf-ocidl-ioleundomanager-close">IOleUndoManager::Close</a> method is called with the <i>fCommit</i> parameter set to <b>TRUE</b>.

The parent undo unit or undo manager must contain any undo unit given to it unless it is blocked. If it is blocked, it must return S_OK but should do nothing else.
