# IEnumConnections::Next


## -description

Retrieves the specified number of items in the enumeration sequence.

## -parameters

### -param cConnections [in]

The number of items to be retrieved. If there are fewer than the requested number of items left in the sequence, this method retrieves the remaining elements.

### -param rgcd [out]

An array of enumerated items.

The enumerator is responsible for allocating any memory, and the caller is responsible for freeing it. If <i>celt</i> is greater than 1, the caller must also pass a non-NULL pointer passed to <i>pceltFetched</i> to know how many pointers to release.

### -param pcFetched [out]

The number of items that were retrieved. This parameter is always less than or equal to the number of items requested.

## -returns

If the method retrieves the number of items requested, the return value is S_OK. Otherwise, it is S_FALSE.

## -remarks

After this method returns successfully, the caller is responsible for calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-release">Release</a> (see the <b>pUnk</b> member of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/ns-ocidl-connectdata">CONNECTDATA</a>) for each element in the array. If <i>cConnections</i> is greater than one, the caller must also pass a non-NULL pointer to <i>lpcFetched</i> to get the number of pointers it has to be released.

E_NOTIMPL is not allowed as a return value. If an error value is returned, no entries in the array are valid on exit, and therefore no release is required.
