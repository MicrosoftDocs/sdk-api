## -description


Contains information that is used to convert between container units, expressed in floating point, and control units, expressed in <b>HIMETRIC</b>. The <b>POINTF</b> structure specifically holds the floating point container units. Controls do not attempt to interpret either value in the structure.

### -field x

The x coordinates of the point in units that the container finds convenient.


### -field y

The y coordinates of the point in units that the container finds convenient.
