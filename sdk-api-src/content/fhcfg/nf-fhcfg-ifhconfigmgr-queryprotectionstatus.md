### -param ProtectedUntilTime [out]

Receives a pointer to a string allocated with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oleauto/nf-oleauto-sysallocstring">SysAllocString</a> containing the date and time until which all files within the File History protection scope are protected. The date and time are formatted per the system locale. If the date and time are unknown, an empty string is returned.

A file is considered protected until a certain point in time if one of the following conditions is true:<ul>
<li>There is a version of that file that was captured at or after that point in time and was fully copied to the currently assigned backup target before now.</li>
<li>The file was created or included in the File History protection scope at or after that point in time.</li>
</ul>



## -returns



If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code such as one of the values defined in the FhErrors.h header file.




## -remarks



The caller is responsible for releasing the memory allocated for <i>ProtectedUntilTime</i> by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oleauto/nf-oleauto-sysfreestring">SysFreeString</a> on it.

The protection state indicates the File History operational state and the date and time until which all files within the protection scope are protected.

If the target is full or disconnected, the File History feature will provide a degraded level of protection as follows: 

<ul>
<li>Files will be backed up to the File History cache on one of the local disks.</li>
<li>If the cache fills up during this time, older copies will be deleted from the cache to back up newer copies.</li>
<li>If the target is low on free space, the degraded level of protection will start once the target becomes full.</li>
</ul>
