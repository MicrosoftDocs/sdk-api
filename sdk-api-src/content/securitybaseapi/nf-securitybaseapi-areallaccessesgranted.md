# AreAllAccessesGranted function


## -description

The <b>AreAllAccessesGranted</b> function checks whether a set of requested access rights has been granted. The access rights are represented as bit flags in an <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/a-gly">access mask</a>.

## -parameters

### -param GrantedAccess [in]

An access mask that specifies the access rights that have been granted.

### -param DesiredAccess [in]

An access mask that specifies the access rights that have been requested. This mask must have been mapped from generic to specific and standard access rights, usually by calling the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-mapgenericmask">MapGenericMask</a> function.

## -returns

If all requested access rights have been granted, the return value is nonzero.

If not all requested access rights have been granted, the return value is zero.

## -remarks

The <b>AreAllAccessesGranted</b> function is commonly used by a server application to check the access rights of a client attempting to gain access to an object. When the bits set in the <i>DesiredAccess</i> parameter match the bits set in the <i>GrantedAccess</i> parameter, all requested rights have been granted.
