# GopherOpenFileA function


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[The <b>GopherOpenFile</b> function is available for use in the operating systems specified in the Requirements section.]

Begins reading a Gopher data file from a Gopher server.


## -parameters




### -param hConnect [in]

Handle to a Gopher session returned by 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wininet/nf-wininet-internetconnecta">InternetConnect</a>.


### -param lpszLocator [in]

Pointer to a <b>null</b>-terminated string that specifies the file to be opened. Generally, this locator is returned from a call to 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wininet/nf-wininet-gopherfindfirstfilea">GopherFindFirstFile</a> or 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wininet/nf-wininet-internetfindnextfilea">InternetFindNextFile</a>. Because the Gopher protocol has no concept of a current directory, the locator is always fully qualified.


### -param lpszView [in]

Pointer to a <b>null</b>-terminated string that describes the view to open if several views of the file exist on the server. If 
<i>lpszView</i> is <b>NULL</b>, the function uses the default file view.


### -param dwFlags [in]

Conditions under which subsequent transfers occur. This parameter can be any of the following values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt>INTERNET_FLAG_HYPERLINK</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Forces a reload if there was no Expires time and no LastModified time returned from the server when determining whether to reload the item from the network.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt>INTERNET_FLAG_NEED_FILE</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Causes a temporary file to be created if the file cannot be cached.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt>INTERNET_FLAG_NO_CACHE_WRITE</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Does not add the returned entity to the cache.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt>INTERNET_FLAG_RELOAD</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Forces a download of the requested file, object, or directory listing from the origin server, not from the cache.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt>INTERNET_FLAG_RESYNCHRONIZE</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Reloads HTTP resources if the resource has been modified since the last time it was downloaded. All FTP and Gopher resources are reloaded.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -param dwContext [in]

Pointer to a variable that contains an application-defined value that associates this operation with any application data.


## -returns



Returns a handle if successful, or <b>NULL</b> if the file cannot be opened. To retrieve extended error information, call 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a> or 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wininet/nf-wininet-internetgetlastresponseinfoa">InternetGetLastResponseInfo</a>.




## -remarks



<b>GopherOpenFile</b> opens a file at a Gopher server. Because a file cannot actually be opened or locked at a server, this function simply associates location information with a handle that an application can use for file-based operations such as 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wininet/nf-wininet-internetreadfile">InternetReadFile</a> or 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wininet/nf-wininet-gophergetattributea">GopherGetAttribute</a>.

After the calling application has finished using the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinInet/appendix-a-hinternet-handles">HINTERNET</a> handle returned by 
<b>GopherOpenFile</b>, it must be closed using the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wininet/nf-wininet-internetclosehandle">InternetCloseHandle</a> function.

Like all other aspects of the WinINet API, this function cannot be safely called from within DllMain or the constructors and destructors of global objects.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  WinINet does not support server implementations. In addition, it should not be used from a service.  For server implementations or services use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinHttp/winhttp-start-page">Microsoft Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP)</a>.</div>
