# HTTP_VERSION_INFO structure


## -description


Contains the global HTTP version.


## -struct-fields




### -field dwMajorVersion

The major version number. Must be 1. 


### -field dwMinorVersion

The minor version number. Can be either 1 or zero. 


## -remarks



On Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, and later, the value in the <b>HTTP_VERSION_INFO</b> structure is overridden by Internet Explorer settings.  <b>EnableHttp1_1</b> is a registry value under <b>HKLM\Software\Microsoft\InternetExplorer\AdvacnedOptions\HTTP\GENABLE</b> controlled by Internet Options set in Internet Explorer for the system.  The <b>EnableHttp1_1</b> value defaults to 1. The <b>HTTP_VERSION_INFO</b> structure is  ignored for any HTTP version less than 1.1 if <b>EnableHttp1_1</b> is set to 1.


<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  WinINet does not support server implementations. In addition, it should not be used from a service.  For server implementations or services use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinHttp/winhttp-start-page">Microsoft Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP)</a>.</div>
