# UnlockUrlCacheEntryFileA function


## -description

Unlocks the cache entry that was locked while the file was retrieved for use from the cache.

## -parameters

### -param lpszUrlName [in]

Pointer to a <b>null</b>-terminated string that specifies the source name of the cache entry that is being unlocked. The name string should not contain any escape characters.

### -param dwReserved [in]

This parameter is reserved and must be 0.

## -returns

Returns <b>TRUE</b> if successful, or <b>FALSE</b> otherwise. To get extended error information, call 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a>. ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND indicates that the cache entry specified by the source name is not found in the cache storage.

## -remarks

The application should not access the file after calling this function.

When this function returns, the cache manager is free to delete the cache entry.

Like all other aspects of the WinINet API, this function cannot be safely called from within DllMain or the constructors and destructors of global objects.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  WinINet does not support server implementations. In addition, it should not be used from a service.  For server implementations or services use <a href="/windows/desktop/WinHttp/winhttp-start-page">Microsoft Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP)</a>.</div>

> [!NOTE]
> The wininet.h header defines UnlockUrlCacheEntryFile as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
