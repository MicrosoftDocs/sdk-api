<a href="/windows/desktop/api/wininet/nf-wininet-internetcrackurla">InternetCrackUrl</a> and

### -field dwSchemeLength

Size of the scheme name, in <b>TCHARs</b>.

### -field nScheme

<a href="/windows/desktop/api/wininet/ne-wininet-internet_scheme">INTERNET_SCHEME</a> value that indicates the Internet protocol scheme.

### -field lpszHostName

## -remarks

For 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/wininet/nf-wininet-internetcrackurla">InternetCrackUrl</a>, if a pointer member and its corresponding length member are both zero, that component is not returned. If the pointer member is <b>NULL</b> but the length member is not zero, both the pointer and length members are returned. If both pointer and corresponding length members are nonzero, the pointer member points to a buffer where the component is copied. The component can be un-escaped, depending on the 
<i>dwFlags</i> parameter of 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/wininet/nf-wininet-internetcrackurla">InternetCrackUrl</a>.

For 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/wininet/nf-wininet-internetcreateurla">InternetCreateUrl</a>, the pointer members should be <b>NULL</b> if the component is not required. If the corresponding length member is zero, the pointer member is the address of a zero-terminated string. If the length member is not zero, it is the string length of the corresponding pointer member.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  WinINet does not support server implementations. In addition, it should not be used from a service.  For server implementations or services use <a href="/windows/desktop/WinHttp/winhttp-start-page">Microsoft Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP)</a>.</div>

> [!NOTE]
> The wininet.h header defines URL_COMPONENTS as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
