# GetUrlCacheEntryInfoExA function


## -description

Retrieves information on the cache entry associated with the specified URL, taking into account any redirections that are applied in offline mode by the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/wininet/nf-wininet-httpsendrequesta">HttpSendRequest</a> function.

## -parameters

### -param lpszUrl [in]

A pointer to a <b>null</b>-terminated string that contains the name of the cache entry. The name string should not contain any escape characters.

### -param lpCacheEntryInfo [in, out, optional]

A pointer to an 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/wininet/ns-wininet-internet_cache_entry_infoa">INTERNET_CACHE_ENTRY_INFO</a> structure that receives information about the cache entry. A buffer should be allocated for this parameter. 

Since the required size of the buffer is not known in advance,  it is best to allocate a buffer adequate to handle the size of most <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wininet/ns-wininet-internet_cache_entry_infoa">INTERNET_CACHE_ENTRY_INFO</a> entries. There is no cache entry size limit, so applications that need to enumerate the cache must be prepared to allocate variable-sized buffers.

### -param lpcbCacheEntryInfo [in, out, optional]

Pointer to a variable that specifies the size of the 
<i>lpCacheEntryInfo</i> buffer, in bytes. When the function returns, the variable contains the number of bytes copied to the buffer, or the required size of the buffer in bytes.

### -param lpszRedirectUrl [out]

This parameter is reserved and must be <b>NULL</b>.

### -param lpcbRedirectUrl [in, out]

This parameter is reserved and must be <b>NULL</b>.

### -param lpReserved

This parameter is reserved and must be <b>NULL</b>.

### -param dwFlags [in]

This parameter is reserved and must be 0.

## -returns

Returns <b>TRUE</b> if the URL was located, or <b>FALSE</b> otherwise. Call 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a> for specific error information. Possible errors include the following.

<th>Description</th>

<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The URL was not found in the cache index, even after taking any cached redirections into account.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The buffer referenced by 
<i>lpCacheEntryInfo</i> was not large enough to hold the requested information. The size of the buffer needed will be returned to 
<i>lpdwCacheEntryInfoBufSize</i>.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## -remarks

<b>GetUrlCacheEntryInfoEx</b> does not do any URL parsing, so a URL containing an anchor (#) will not be found in the cache, even if the resource is cached. For example, if the URL http://example.com/example.htm#sample is passed, the function returns ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND even if http://example.com/example.htm is in the cache.

Like all other aspects of the WinINet API, this function cannot be safely called from within DllMain or the constructors and destructors of global objects.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  WinINet does not support server implementations. In addition, it should not be used from a service.  For server implementations or services use <a href="/windows/desktop/WinHttp/winhttp-start-page">Microsoft Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP)</a>.</div>

> [!NOTE]
> The wininet.h header defines GetUrlCacheEntryInfoEx as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
