# ID2D1CommandList::Close


## -description

Instructs the command list to stop accepting commands so that you can use it as an input to an effect or in a call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d2d1_1/nf-d2d1_1-id2d1commandsink-drawimage">ID2D1DeviceContext::DrawImage</a>.  You should call the method after it has been attached to an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d2d1_1/nn-d2d1_1-id2d1devicecontext">ID2D1DeviceContext</a>  and written to but before the command list is used.

<table>
<tr>
<th>HRESULT</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>S_OK</td>
<td>No error occurred.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D2DERR_WRONG_STATE </td>
<td>Close has already been called on the command list.</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  If the device context associated with the command list has an error, the command list returns the same error.</div>

This method returns D2DERR_WRONG_STATE if it has already been called on the command list. If an error occurred on the device context during population, the method returns that error. Otherwise, the method returns S_OK. 

If the <b>Close</b> method returns an error, any future use of the command list results in the same error.
