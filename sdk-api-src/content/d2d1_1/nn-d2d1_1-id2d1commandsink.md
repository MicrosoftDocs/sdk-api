# ID2D1CommandSink interface


## -description

The command sink is implemented by you for an application when you want to receive a playback of the commands recorded in a command list. A typical usage will be for transforming the command list into another format such as XPS when some degree of conversion between the <a href="/windows/desktop/Direct2D/direct2d-portal">Direct2D</a> primitives and the target format is required.



The command sink interface doesn't have any resource creation methods on it. The resources are still logically bound to the <a href="/windows/desktop/Direct2D/direct2d-portal">Direct2D</a> device on which the command list was created and will be passed in to the command sink implementation.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">ID2D1CommandSink</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>ID2D1CommandSink</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

The <b>ID2D1CommandSink</b> can be implemented to receive a play-back of the commands recorded in a command list. This interface is typically used for transforming the command list into another format  where some degree of conversion between the Direct2D primitives and the target format is required.
      
      

The <b>ID2D1CommandSink</b> interface does not have any resource creation methods. The resources are logically bound to the Direct2D device on which the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d2d1_1/nn-d2d1_1-id2d1commandlist">ID2D1CommandList</a> was created and will be passed in to the <b>ID2D1CommandSink</b> implementation.
      
      

Not all methods implemented by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d2d1_1/nn-d2d1_1-id2d1devicecontext">ID2D1DeviceContext</a> are present.
