# DIRECTMANIPULATION_DRAG_DROP_STATUS enumeration


## -description


Defines the drag-and-drop interaction states for the viewport.


## -enum-fields




### -field DIRECTMANIPULATION_DRAG_DROP_READY

The viewport is at rest and ready for input.


### -field DIRECTMANIPULATION_DRAG_DROP_PRESELECT

The viewport is updating its content and the content is not selected.


### -field DIRECTMANIPULATION_DRAG_DROP_SELECTING

The viewport is updating its content and the content is selected.


### -field DIRECTMANIPULATION_DRAG_DROP_DRAGGING

The viewport is updating its content and the content is being dragged.


### -field DIRECTMANIPULATION_DRAG_DROP_CANCELLED

The viewport has concluded the interaction and requests a revert.


### -field DIRECTMANIPULATION_DRAG_DROP_COMMITTED

The viewport has concluded the interaction and requests a commit.


## -remarks



For each interaction, the status always starts at <b>DIRECTMANIPULATION_DRAG_DROP_READY</b> and ends at either <b>DIRECTMANIPULATION_DRAG_DROP_CANCELLED</b> or <b>DIRECTMANIPULATION_DRAG_DROP_COMMITTED</b>. There are no explicit callbacks for the transition from CANCELLED/COMMITTED to READY.


The meaning of the CANCELLED and COMMITED values depend on the previous status.

<ul>
<li>For <b>DIRECTMANIPULATION_DRAG_DROP_PRESELECT</b>, they mean the same thing: the content goes back to the original location and no other actions should be taken.</li>
<li>FOR <b>DIRECTMANIPULATION_DRAG_DROP_SELECTING</b>, COMMITED means apply the selection change; CANCELLED means avoid the selection change.</li>
<li>For <b>DIRECTMANIPULATION_DRAG_DROP_DRAGGING</b>, COMMITED means perform the drop action; CANCELLED means cancel the drop action.</li>
</ul>
