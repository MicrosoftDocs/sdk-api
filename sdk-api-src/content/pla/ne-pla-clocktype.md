# ClockType enumeration


## -description


Defines the clock resolution to use when tracing events.


## -enum-fields




### -field plaTimeStamp

Use the raw (unconverted) time stamp.


### -field plaPerformance

Query performance counter. This counter provides a high-resolution (100 nanoseconds) time stamp but is more resource-intensive to retrieve than  system time.


### -field plaSystem

System time. The system time provides a low-resolution (10 milliseconds) time stamp but is less resource-intensive to retrieve than the query performance counter. 


### -field plaCycle

CPU cycle counter. The CPU counter provides the highest resolution time stamp and is the least resource-intensive to retrieve. However, the CPU counter is unreliable and should not be used in production. 


## -remarks



For details, see the <b>ClientContext</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/ETW/wnode-header">WNODE_HEADER</a> structure.
