# MFASYNCRESULT structure


## -description

Contains data that is needed to implement the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mfobjects/nn-mfobjects-imfasyncresult">IMFAsyncResult</a> interface.

## -struct-fields

### -field AsyncResult

### -field overlapped

An <b>OVERLAPPED</b> structure. 
This structure is used internally to queue the work item. 
Fill this member with zeros.

### -field pCallback

Pointer to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mfobjects/nn-mfobjects-imfasynccallback">IMFAsyncCallback</a> interface. 
This interface is implemented by the caller of the asynchronous method. 
This member can be <b>NULL</b>. If this member is <b>NULL</b>, the <b>hEvent</b> member must be a valid event handle.

### -field hrStatusResult

The status code returned when this structure is used with an I/O completion port. 
You can also use this member to hold the status code for the asynchronous operation, returned by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mfobjects/nf-mfobjects-imfasyncresult-getstatus">IMFAsyncResult::GetStatus</a>.

### -field dwBytesTransferred

The number of bytes transferred when this structure is used with an I/O completion port. 
This member is used internally by the work queue. Set this member to zero.

### -field hEvent

Event handle. If <b>pCallback</b> is <b>NULL</b>, set this member to a valid event handle. 
The event is signaled when the work item is dispatched. Otherwise, set this member to <b>NULL</b>.

## -remarks

Any custom implementation of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mfobjects/nn-mfobjects-imfasyncresult">IMFAsyncResult</a> interface must inherit this structure. 
For more information, see <a href="/windows/desktop/medfound/custom-asynchronous-result-objects">Custom Asynchronous Result Objects</a>.
