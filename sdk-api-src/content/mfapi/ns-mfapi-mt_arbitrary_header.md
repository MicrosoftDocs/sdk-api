# MT_ARBITRARY_HEADER structure


## -description


Contains format data for a binary stream in an Advanced Streaming Format (ASF) file.


## -struct-fields




### -field majortype

Major media type. This value is the GUID stored in the Major Media Type field of the Type-Specific Data field of the ASF file. It might not match the major type GUID from the Media Foundation media type. 


### -field subtype

Media subtype.
          


### -field bFixedSizeSamples

If <b>TRUE</b>, samples have a fixed size in bytes.
          Otherwise, samples have variable size.


### -field bTemporalCompression

If <b>TRUE</b>, the data in this stream uses temporal compression. Otherwise, samples are independent of each other.


### -field lSampleSize

If <b>bFixedSizeSamples</b> is <b>TRUE</b>, this member specifies the sample size in bytes. Otherwise, the value is ignored and should be 0.


### -field formattype

Format type GUID. This GUID identifies the structure of the additional format data, which is stored in the 
          <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/medfound/mf-mt-arbitrary-format">MF_MT_ARBITRARY_FORMAT</a> attribute of the media type. If no additional format data is present, <b>formattype</b> equals GUID_NULL.


## -remarks



This structure is used with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/medfound/mf-mt-arbitrary-header">MF_MT_ARBITRARY_HEADER</a> media type attribute.

This structure corresponds to the first 60 bytes of the Type-Specific Data field of the Stream Properties Object, in files where the stream type is ASF_Binary_Media. For more information, see the ASF specification.

The Format Data field of the Type-Specific Data field is contained in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/medfound/mf-mt-arbitrary-format">MF_MT_ARBITRARY_FORMAT</a> attribute of the media type.
