# MFCameraIntrinsic_PinholeCameraModel structure


## -description


Represents a pinhole camera model. 


## -struct-fields




### -field FocalLength

The focal length of the camera.


### -field PrincipalPoint

The principal point of the camera.


## -remarks



For square pixels, the X and Y fields of the <b>FocalLength</b> should be the same. The units of the focal length fields are pixels per meter, so dividing the width and height of the image by the X and Y fields of the focal length, respectively, yields the physical size in meters of the image at a distance of one meter from the sensor.

The <b>PrincipalPoint</b> field is expressed in pixels, not in normalized coordinates. The  origin [0,0] is the bottom, left corner of the image.
