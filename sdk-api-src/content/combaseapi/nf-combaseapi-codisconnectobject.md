# CoDisconnectObject function


## -description

Disconnects all remote process connections being maintained on behalf of all the interface pointers that point to a specified object.

Only the process that actually manages the object should call <b>CoDisconnectObject</b>.

## -parameters

### -param pUnk [in]

A pointer to any interface derived from <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> on the object to be disconnected.

### -param dwReserved [in]

This parameter is reserved and must be 0.

## -returns

This function returns S_OK to indicate that all connections to remote processes were successfully deleted.

## -remarks

The <b>CoDisconnectObject</b> function enables a server to correctly disconnect all external clients to the object specified by <i>pUnk</i>.

It performs the following tasks:

<ol>
<li>Checks to see whether the object to be disconnected implements the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-imarshal">IMarshal</a> interface. If so, it gets the pointer to that interface; if not, it gets a pointer to the standard marshaler's (i.e., COM's) <b>IMarshal</b> implementation.</li>
<li>Using whichever <a href="/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-imarshal">IMarshal</a> interface pointer it has acquired, the function then calls <a href="/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-imarshal-disconnectobject">IMarshal::DisconnectObject</a> to disconnect all out-of-process clients.</li>
</ol>
An object's client does not call <b>CoDisconnectObject</b> to disconnect itself from the server (clients should use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-release">IUnknown::Release</a> for this purpose). Rather, an OLE server calls <b>CoDisconnectObject</b> to forcibly disconnect an object's clients, usually in response to a user closing the server application.

Similarly, an OLE container that supports external links to its embedded objects can call <b>CoDisconnectObject</b> to destroy those links. Again, this call is normally made in response to a user closing the application. The container should first call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/oleidl/nf-oleidl-ioleobject-close">IOleObject::Close</a> for all its OLE objects, each of which should send <a href="/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-iadvisesink-onclose">IAdviseSink::OnClose</a> notifications to their various clients. Then the container can call <b>CoDisconnectObject</b> to close any existing connections.



<b>CoDisconnectObject</b> does not necessarily disconnect out-of-process clients immediately. If any marshaled calls are pending on the server object, <b>CoDisconnectObject</b> disconnects the object only when those calls have returned. In the meantime, <b>CoDisconnectObject</b> sets a flag that causes any new marshaled calls to return CO_E_OBJNOTCONNECTED.
