# CoAllowUnmarshalerCLSID function


## -description


Adds an unmarshaler CLSID to the allowed list for the calling process only.


## -parameters




### -param clsid [in]

The CLSID of the unmarshaler to be added to the per-process allowed list.


## -returns



If this function succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



Don't call the <b>CoAllowUnmarshalerCLSID</b> function until after <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coinitializesecurity">CoInitializeSecurity</a> has been called in the current process.

The <b>CoAllowUnmarshalerCLSID</b> function provides more granular control over unmarshaling policy than is provided by the policy options. If the process applies any unmarshaling policy, the effect of the <b>CoAllowUnmarshalerCLSID</b> function is to make the policy comparatively weaker. For this reason, only call <b>CoAllowUnmarshalerCLSID</b> when the security impact is well understood. Usually, this is used to facilitate applying a stronger unmarshaling policy option for the broad attack surface reduction this provides, when a specific unmarshaler CLSID not allowed by that option is needed due to other constraints.

For example, it's appropriate to call the <b>CoAllowUnmarshalerCLSID</b> function when an unmarshaler is known or believed to have a vulnerability but is required by an app. Also, it's appropriate to call <b>CoAllowUnmarshalerCLSID</b> if the unmarshaler is used in multiple processes, but only as part of an uncommon feature. Don't use the <b>CoAllowUnmarshalerCLSID</b> function as a replacement for hardening the unmarshaler.
