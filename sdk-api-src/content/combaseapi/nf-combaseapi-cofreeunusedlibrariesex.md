## -description

Unloads any DLLs that are no longer in use and whose unload delay has expired.

## -parameters

### -param dwUnloadDelay [in]

The delay in milliseconds between the time that the DLL has stated it can be unloaded until it becomes a candidate to unload. Setting this parameter to INFINITE uses the system default delay (10 minutes). Setting this parameter to 0 forces the unloading of any DLLs without any delay.

### -param dwReserved [in]

This parameter is reserved and must be 0.

## -remarks

COM supplies functions to reclaim memory held by DLLs containing components. The most commonly used function is <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cofreeunusedlibraries">CoFreeUnusedLibraries</a>. <b>CoFreeUnusedLibraries</b> does not immediately release DLLs that have no active object. There is a 10-minute delay for multithreaded apartments (MTAs) and neutral apartments (NAs). For single-threaded apartments (STAs), there is no delay.



The 10-minute delay for <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cofreeunusedlibraries">CoFreeUnusedLibraries</a> is to avoid multithread race conditions caused by unloading a component DLL. This default delay may be too long for many applications.



COM maintains a list of active DLLs that have had components loaded for the apartments that can be hosted on the thread where this function is called. When <b>CoFreeUnusedLibrariesEx</b> is called, each DLL on that list has its <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-dllcanunloadnow">DllCanUnloadNow</a> function called. If <b>DllCanUnloadNow</b> returns S_FALSE (or is not exported), this DLL is not ready to be unloaded. If <b>DllCanUnloadNow</b> returns S_OK, this DLL is moved off the active list to a "candidate-for-unloading" list.



Adding the DLL to the candidate-for-unloading list time-stamps the DLL <i>dwUnloadDelay</i> milliseconds from when this move occurs. When <b>CoFreeUnusedLibrariesEx</b> (or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cofreeunusedlibraries">CoFreeUnusedLibraries</a>) is called again, at least <i>dwUnloadDelay</i> milliseconds from the call that moved the DLL to the candidate-for-unloading list, the DLL is actually freed from memory. If COM uses the component DLL while the DLL is on the candidate-for-unloading list, it is moved back to the active list.



Setting <i>dwUnloadDelay</i> to 0 may have unexpected consequences. The component DLL may need some time for cleanup after it returns from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-dllcanunloadnow">DllCanUnloadNow</a> function. For example, if the DLL had its own worker threads, using a value of 0 would most likely lead to a problem because the code executing on these threads would be unmapped, caused by the unloading of the DLL before the worker threads have a chance to exit. Also, using too brief of a value for <i>dwUnloadDelay</i> can lead to performance issues because there is more overhead in reloading a DLL than letting it page out.

This behavior is triggered by the DLL supplying components with threading models set to Free, Neutral, or Both. For a threading model set to Apartment (or if no threading model is specified), <i>dwUnloadDelay</i> is treated as 0 because these components are tied to the single thread hosting the apartment.
