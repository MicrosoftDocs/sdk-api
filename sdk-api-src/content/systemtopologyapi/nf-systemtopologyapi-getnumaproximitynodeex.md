# GetNumaProximityNodeEx function


## -description


Retrieves the NUMA node number that corresponds to  the specified proximity identifier as a <b>USHORT</b> value.


## -parameters




### -param ProximityId [in]

The proximity identifier of the node.


### -param NodeNumber [out]

Points to a variable to receive the node number for the specified proximity identifier.


## -returns



If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero.

If the function fails, the return value is zero.




## -remarks



A proximity domain identifier is an index to a NUMA node on a NUMA system. Proximity domain identifiers are found in the ACPI System Resource Affinity Table (SRAT), where they are used to associate processors and memory regions with a particular NUMA node. Proximity domain identifiers are also found in the ACPI namespace, where they are used to associate a device with a particular NUMA node. Proximity domain identifiers are typically used only by management applications provided by system manufacturers. Windows does not use proximity domain identifiers to identify NUMA nodes; instead, it assigns a unique number to each NUMA node in the system.

The relative distance between nodes on a system is stored in the ACPI System Locality Distance Information Table (SLIT), which is not exposed by any Windows functions. For more information about ACPI tables, see the <a href="http://www.acpi.info/">ACPI specifications</a>.

The only difference between the <b>GetNumaProximityNodeEx</b> function and the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getnumaproximitynode">GetNumaProximityNode</a> function is the data type of the <i>NodeNumber</i> parameter.

To compile an application that uses this function, set _WIN32_WINNT &gt;= 0x0601. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/using-the-windows-headers">Using the Windows Headers</a>.
