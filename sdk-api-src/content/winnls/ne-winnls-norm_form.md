# NORM_FORM enumeration


## -description


Specifies the supported normalization forms.


## -enum-fields




### -field NormalizationOther

Not supported.


### -field NormalizationC

Unicode normalization form C, canonical composition. Transforms each decomposed grouping, consisting of a base character plus combining characters, to the canonical precomposed equivalent. For example, A + ¨ becomes Ä.


### -field NormalizationD

Unicode normalization form D, canonical decomposition. Transforms each precomposed character to its canonical decomposed equivalent. For example, Ä becomes A + ¨.


### -field NormalizationKC

Unicode normalization form KC, compatibility composition. Transforms each base plus combining characters to the canonical precomposed equivalent and all compatibility characters to their equivalents. For example, the ligature ﬁ becomes f + i; similarly, A + ¨ + ﬁ + n becomes Ä + f + i + n.


### -field NormalizationKD

Unicode normalization form KD, compatibility decomposition. Transforms each precomposed character to its canonical decomposed equivalent and all compatibility characters to their equivalents. For example, Ä + ﬁ + n becomes A + ¨ + f + i + n.


## -remarks
