<p class="CCE_Message">[This function is available for use in the operating systems indicated in the Requirements section. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions.

### -param LogSectionName [in]

Optional pointer to the name for a logical grouping of names within the log file. You should use a <b>null</b>-terminated string.  Required if SPFILELOG_SYSTEMLOG was not passed when the file log was initialized. Otherwise, this parameter can be <b>NULL</b>.

### -param SourceFilename [in]

Name of the file as it exists on the source media from which it was installed. This name should be in whatever format is meaningful to the caller. You should use a <b>null</b>-terminated string.

Optional pointer to a  checksum value. Required for the system log.

### -param DiskTagfile [in]

Optional pointer to the tagfile for the media from which the file was installed. You should use a <b>null</b>-terminated string. The <b>null</b>-terminated string should not exceed the size of the destination buffer. Ignored for the system log if SPFILELOG_OEMFILE is not specified. Required for the system log if SPFILELOG_OEMFILE is specified. Otherwise, this parameter can be <b>NULL</b>.

### -param DiskDescription [in]

Optional pointer to the human-readable description of the media from which the file was installed. You should use a <b>null</b>-terminated string.

## -remarks

> [!NOTE]
> The setupapi.h header defines SetupLogFile as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
