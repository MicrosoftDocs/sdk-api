# SetupScanFileQueueA function


## -description

<p class="CCE_Message">[This function is available for use in the operating systems indicated in the Requirements section. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions.   SetupAPI should no longer be used for installing applications. Instead, use the Windows Installer for developing application installers. SetupAPI continues to be used for installing device drivers.]

The 
<b>SetupScanFileQueue</b> function scans a setup file queue, performing an operation on each node in its copy list. The operation is specified by a set of flags. This function can be called either before or after the queue has been committed.

## -parameters

### -param FileQueue [in]

Handle to the setup file queue whose copy list is to be scanned or iterated.

### -param Flags [in]

Flags to combine to control the file queue scan operation. Note that either SPQ_SCAN_FILE_PRESENCE, SPQ_SCAN_USE_CALLBACK, SPQ_SCAN_USE_CALLBACKEX, or SPQ_SCAN_FILE_VALIDITY must be specified.

### -param Window [in]

Optional handle to the window to own dialog boxes that are presented. This parameter is not used if the <i>Flags</i> parameter does not contain SPQ_SCAN_FILE_PRESENCE or if <i>Flags</i> does not contain SPQ_SCAN_INFORM_USER.

### -param CallbackRoutine [in]

Optional pointer to a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/setupapi/nc-setupapi-psp_file_callback_a">FileCallback</a> callback function to be called on each node of the copy queue. The notification code passed to the callback function is 
<a href="/windows/desktop/SetupApi/spfilenotify-queuescan">SPFILENOTIFY_QUEUESCAN</a>. This parameter is required if <i>Flags</i> includes SPQ_SCAN_USE_CALLBACK. 




<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  You must supply the callback routine specified by <i>CallbackRoutine</i>. The default queue callback routine does not support 
<b>SetupScanFileQueue</b>.</div>
<div> </div>

### -param CallbackContext [in]

Optional pointer to a context that contains caller-defined data passed to the callback routine pointed to by <i>CallbackRoutine</i>.

### -param Result [out]

Pointer to a variable that receives the result of the scan operation.

## -returns

The function returns a nonzero value if all nodes in the queue were processed.

If the SPQ_SCAN_USE_CALLBACK flag was set, the value in <i>Result</i> is 0. The callback routine specified by <i>CallbackRoutine</i> is sent the notification SPFILENOTIFY_QUEUESCAN. <i>CallbackRoutine.Param1</i> specifies a pointer to an array that contains the target path information. The pointer has been cast to an unsigned integer and must be recast to a TCHAR array of MAX_PATH elements before a callback routine can access the information. <i>CallbackRoutine.Param2</i> is set to SPQ_DELAYED_COPY if the current queue node is in use and cannot be copied until the system is restarted. Otherwise, <i>CallbackRoutine.Param2</i> takes the value 0.

If SPQ_SCAN_USE_CALLBACK was not set, <i>Result</i> indicates whether the queue passed the presence or validity check as shown in the following table.

<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>0</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The queue failed the check or it passed the check, but SPQ_SCAN_INFORM_USER was specified and the user wants new copies of the files.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>1</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The queue passed the check and, if SPQ_SCAN_INFORM_USER was specified, the user indicated that copying is not required. The copy queue is empty and there are no elements on the delete or rename queues, so the caller can skip queue commit.

</td>

<td width="60%">
The queue passed the check and, if SPQ_SCAN_INFORM_USER was specified, the user indicated that copying is not required. The copy queue is empty, but there are elements on the delete or rename queues, so the caller cannot skip queue commit.

The function returns zero if an error occurred or the callback function returned nonzero. If <i>Result</i> is nonzero, it is the value returned by the callback function that stopped queue processing. If <i>Result</i> is zero, extended error information can be retrieved by a call to 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a>.

## -remarks

> [!NOTE]
> The setupapi.h header defines SetupScanFileQueue as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
