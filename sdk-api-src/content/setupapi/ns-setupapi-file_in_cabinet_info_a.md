# FILE_IN_CABINET_INFO_A structure


## -description

The 
<b>FILE_IN_CABINET_INFO</b> structure provides information about a file found in the cabinet. The 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/setupapi/nf-setupapi-setupiteratecabineta">SetupIterateCabinet</a> function sends this structure as one of the parameters when it sends a 
<a href="/windows/desktop/SetupApi/spfilenotify-fileincabinet">SPFILENOTIFY_FILEINCABINET</a> notification to the cabinet callback routine.

### -field FileSize

## -remarks

> [!NOTE]
> The setupapi.h header defines FILE_IN_CABINET_INFO as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
