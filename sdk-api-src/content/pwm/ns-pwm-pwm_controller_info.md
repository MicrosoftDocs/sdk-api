# PWM_CONTROLLER_INFO structure


## -description


Represents the static information that characterizes a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) controller. 


## -struct-fields




### -field Size

The size of the structure, which includes the <b>Size</b> member. The structure byte size is used for versioning. 


### -field PinCount

The number of available pins or channels of the controller, which must be greater than zero (0).


### -field MinimumPeriod

The minimum supported output signal period, in picoseconds, for the controller. This value must be greater than zero and less than or equal the <b>MaximumPeriod</b> value.


### -field MaximumPeriod

The maximum supported output signal period, in picoseconds, for the controller. This value must be greater than zero and greater than or equal the <b>MinimumPeriod</b> value.
