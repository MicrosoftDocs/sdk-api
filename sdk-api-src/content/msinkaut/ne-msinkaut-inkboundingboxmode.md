# InkBoundingBoxMode enumeration


## -description

Specifies which characteristics of a stroke, such as drawing attributes, are used to calculate the bounding box of the ink.

The bounding box is the smallest rectangle that includes all points in the <a href="/windows/desktop/tablet/inkdisp-class">InkDisp</a> object. The size of the rectangle varies depending on whether you use drawing attributes, Bezier curve fitting, or just the points of the stroke to calculate the rectangle.

## -enum-fields

### -field IBBM_Default

 The definition of each stroke (polyline or Bezier) is used to calculate the bounding box; includes the drawing attributes, such as pen width, in the calculation.

### -field IBBM_NoCurveFit

 The polyline of the strokes (ignoring Bezier curve fitting requests) is used to calculate the bounding box; includes the drawing attributes in the calculation.

### -field IBBM_CurveFit

The  Bezier curve fitting line of the strokes (apply Bezier curve fitting to all strokes) is used to calculate the bounding box; includes the drawing attributes in the calculation.

### -field IBBM_PointsOnly

 Only the points of the strokes are used to calculate the bounding box.

### -field IBBM_Union

 The union of a NoCurveFit request and a CurveFit request.
