# InkApplicationGesture enumeration


## -description

Defines values that set the interest in a set of application-specific gesture.

Application gestures are gestures that you can choose to have your application support. Applications that are specifically designed to work with a pen are more likely to use these gestures than applications designed for mouse and keyboard.

The <b>Tap</b> and <b>DoubleTap</b> gestures are supported as application gestures and system gestures (system gestures are defined in the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/msinkaut/ne-msinkaut-inksystemgesture">InkSystemGesture</a> enumeration type). This means you can incorporate an application gesture that has a component that may be construed as a <b>Tap</b> or <b>DoubleTap</b> (such as the <b>Exclamation</b> gesture). In this case, enable the <b>Tap</b> application gesture and disable the <b>Tap</b> system gesture in your application. When a user taps, the application gesture is recognized. This allows your application to listen for a single component that can both identify and distinguish a system gesture <b>Tap</b> from a <b>Tap</b> within the application gesture.

In addition to the following list of gestures, Microsoft intends to support many gesture glyphs as part of the Microsoft gesture recognizer. For more information about these unimplemented gesture glyphs, see <a href="/windows/desktop/tablet/unimplemented-glyphs">Unimplemented Glyphs</a>.

For more information about application gestures and system gestures, see <a href="/windows/desktop/tablet/using-gestures">Using Gestures</a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/tablet/pen-input--ink--and-recognition">Pen Input, Ink, and Recognition</a>.

## -remarks

The default value is <b>NoGesture</b>, which is actually a cutoff line that represents the Microsoft gesture recognizer minimum suggested confidence. It does not actually represent a gesture or lack of gesture, just the point at which the gesture recognizer lacks enough confidence in the result accuracy to recommend anything following that point.

For example, assume that a gesture array consists of the following values: <b>Circle</b>, <b>LeftRight</b>, <b>NoGesture</b>, <b>RightLeft</b>, and <b>Triangle</b>. In this case, the gesture recognizer has a great degree of confidence in <b>Circle</b> and less confidence in <b>LeftRight</b>. The recognizer has very low confidence in <b>RightLeft</b> and <b>Triangle</b> because they come after <b>NoGesture</b> in the array order.

The confidence level at which the gesture recognizer returns <b>NoGesture</b> cannot be changed.

If <b>NoGesture</b> is the first element in the array (which means that every recognized gesture is below the suggested confidence threshold), then the platform alters the default value of the <i>Cancel</i> parameter in the <a href="/windows/desktop/tablet/inkcollector-gesture">Gesture</a> event handler from <b>FALSE</b> to <b>TRUE</b>. This causes the ink to be considered a stroke and not be deleted from the <a href="/windows/desktop/tablet/inkdisp-class">InkDisp</a> object by default.
