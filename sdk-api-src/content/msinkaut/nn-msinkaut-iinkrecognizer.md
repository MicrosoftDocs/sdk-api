# IInkRecognizer interface


## -description

Represents the ability to process ink, or handwriting, and translate the stroke into text or gesture. The recognizer creates an <a href="/windows/desktop/tablet/inkrecognizercontext-class">InkRecognizerContext</a> object, which is used to perform the actual handwriting recognition.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IInkRecognizer</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IInkRecognizer</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Properties</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

A recognizer has specific attributes and properties that allow it to perform recognition. The properties of a recognizer must be determined before recognition can occur. The types of properties that a recognizer supports determine the types of recognition it can perform. For instance, if a recognizer doesn't support cursive handwriting, it returns inaccurate results when a user writes in cursive.

A recognizer also has built-in functionality that automatically manages many aspects of handwriting. For instance, it determines the metrics for the lines on which strokes are drawn. You can return the line number of a stroke, but you never need to specify how those line metrics are determined because of the built-in functionality of the recognizer.

For more information about recognition, see <a href="/windows/desktop/tablet/about-handwriting-recognition">About Handwriting Recognition</a>.

If you define a class that implements this interface, the new class will not interact correctly with the Tablet PC application programming interfaces (APIs).
