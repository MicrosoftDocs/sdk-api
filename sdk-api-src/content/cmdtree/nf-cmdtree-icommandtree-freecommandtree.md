# ICommandTree::FreeCommandTree


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/search/-search-3x-wds-overview">Windows Search</a> for client side search and  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=18914">Microsoft Search Server Express</a> for server side search.]

The <b>ICommandTree::FreeCommandTree</b> method traverses a command tree and deallocates all <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/indexsrv/dbcommandtree">DBCOMMANDTREE</a> node structures, as well as all variants in those structures. It then sets the root pointer to a <b>NULL</b> pointer.


## -parameters




### -param ppRoot [in]

Pointer to a variable that receives the pointer to the root of the command tree on successful exit.


## -returns



This method can return one of these values.

## -remarks



The <b>FreeCommandTree</b> method can be used by a consumer to free its copy of the command tree constructed locally or obtained by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/cmdtree/nf-cmdtree-icommandtree-getcommandtree">ICommandTree::GetCommandTree</a>. It does not free the copy of the tree owned by the command object. When a consumer calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/cmdtree/nf-cmdtree-icommandtree-setcommandtree">SetCommandTree</a> with <i>fCopy</i> = <b>FALSE</b>, the consumer relinquishes ownership of the memory to the provider. Therefore, if the consumer calls <b>FreeCommandTree</b> after having called <b>SetCommandTree</b> with <i>fCopy</i> = <b>FALSE</b>, <b>FreeCommandTree</b> returns a DB_E_CANNOTFREE error code, meaning the consumer does not have ownership of the tree and is unable to free it.
