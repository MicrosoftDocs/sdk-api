# EVENT_FILTER_LEVEL_KW structure


## -description

The <b>EVENT_FILTER_LEVEL_KW</b> structure defines event IDs used in an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/evntprov/ns-evntprov-event_filter_descriptor">EVENT_FILTER_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure for a stack walk level-keyword filter.

This filter is only applied to events that are otherwise enabled
on the logging session, via a level/keyword in the enable call.

## -struct-fields

### -field MatchAnyKeyword

Bitmask of keywords that determine the category of events to filter on.

### -field MatchAllKeyword

This bitmask is optional. This mask further restricts the category of events that you want to filter on. If the event's keyword meets the <b>MatchAnyKeyword</b> condition, the provider will filter the event only if all of the bits in this mask exist in the event's keyword. This mask is not used if <b>MatchAnyKeyword</b> is zero.

### -field Level

Defines the severity level of the event to filter on.

### -field FilterIn

<b>true</b> to filter the events matching the provided names in; <b>false</b> to filter them out.

If set to <b>true</b>, the filtered events will have stacks collected.
