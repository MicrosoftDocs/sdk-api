# D2D1_ROUNDED_RECT structure


## -description


Contains the dimensions and corner radii of a rounded rectangle.


## -struct-fields




### -field rect

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Direct2D/d2d1-rect-f">D2D1_RECT_F</a></b>

The coordinates of the rectangle.


### -field radiusX

Type: <b>FLOAT</b>

The x-radius for the quarter ellipse that is drawn to replace every corner of the rectangle.


### -field radiusY

Type: <b>FLOAT</b>

The y-radius for the quarter ellipse that is drawn to replace every corner of the rectangle.


## -remarks



Each corner of the rectangle specified by the <i>rect</i> is replaced with a quarter ellipse, with a radius in each direction specified by <i>radiusX</i> and <i>radiusY</i>.

 If the <i>radiusX</i> is greater than or equal to half the width of the rectangle, and the <i>radiusY</i> is greater than or equal to one-half the height, the rounded rectangle is an ellipse with the same width and height of the <i>rect</i>. 

Even when both <i>radiuX</i> and <i>radiusY</i> are zero, the rounded rectangle is different from a rectangle., When stroked, the corners of the rounded rectangle are roundly joined, not mitered (square).
