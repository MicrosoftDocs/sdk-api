# D2D1_BEZIER_SEGMENT structure


## -description


Represents a cubic bezier segment drawn  between two points.


## -struct-fields




### -field point1

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/Direct2D/d2d1-point-2f">D2D1_POINT_2F</a></b>

The first control point for the Bezier segment.


### -field point2

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/Direct2D/d2d1-point-2f">D2D1_POINT_2F</a></b>

The second control point for the Bezier segment.


### -field point3

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/Direct2D/d2d1-point-2f">D2D1_POINT_2F</a></b>

The end point for the Bezier segment.


## -remarks



A cubic Bezier curve is defined by four points: a start point, an end point (<i>point3</i>), and two control points (<i>point1</i> and <i>point2</i>). A Bezier segment does not contain a property for the starting point of the curve; it defines only the end point. The beginning point of the curve is the current point of the path to which the Bezier curve is added.

The two control points of a cubic Bezier curve behave like magnets, attracting portions of what would otherwise be a straight line toward themselves and producing a curve. The first control point, <i>point1</i>, affects the beginning portion of the curve; the second control point, <i>point2</i>, affects the ending portion of the curve. 

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The curve doesn't necessarily pass through either of the control points; each control point moves its portion of the line toward itself, but not through itself.</div>
