# ID2D1SimplifiedGeometrySink::AddLines


## -description


Creates a sequence of lines using the specified points and adds them to the geometry sink.


## -parameters




### -param points [in]

Type: <b>const <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Direct2D/d2d1-point-2f">D2D1_POINT_2F</a>*</b>

A pointer to an array of one or more points that describe the lines to draw. A line is drawn from the geometry sink's current point (the end point of the last segment drawn or the location specified by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d2d1/nf-d2d1-id2d1simplifiedgeometrysink-beginfigure">BeginFigure</a>) to the first point in the array. if the array contains additional points, a line is drawn from the first point to the second point in the array, from the second point to the third point, and so on.   


### -param pointsCount

Type: <b>UINT</b>

The number of points in the <i>points</i> array.
