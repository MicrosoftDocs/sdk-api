# IOpcRelationshipSet interface


## -description

Represents a Relationships part as an unordered set of <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/msopc/nn-msopc-iopcrelationship">IOpcRelationship</a> interface pointers to relationship objects.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IOpcRelationshipSet</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IOpcRelationshipSet</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

When a relationship object is created and a pointer to it is added to the set, the relationship it represents is saved when the package is saved.

When an  <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/msopc/nn-msopc-iopcrelationship">IOpcRelationship</a> interface pointer is deleted from the set, the relationship it represents is not saved when the package is saved.

If a relationship is represented in the set, the relationship is stored in the Relationships part represented as the set.

For how to form the part name for the target of a relationship, see <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/opc/resolving-a-part-name-from-a-relationship-s-target-uri">Resolving a Part Name from a Target URI</a>.

For more information about relationships, see <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/opc/open-packaging-conventions-overview">Open Packaging Conventions Fundamentals</a> and the <i>ECMA-376 OpenXML, 1st Edition, Part 2: Open Packaging Conventions (OPC)</i>.

The <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/msopc/nn-msopc-iopcrelationship">IOpcRelationship</a> interface provides access to relationship properties. For details about these properties, see the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/opc/relationships-overview">Relationships Overview</a> and <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/msopc/nn-msopc-iopcrelationship">IOpcRelationship</a>.


#### Thread Safety

Packaging objects are not thread-safe.
