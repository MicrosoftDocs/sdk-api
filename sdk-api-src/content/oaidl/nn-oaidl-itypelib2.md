# ITypeLib2 interface


## -description

Represents a type library, the data that describes a set of objects.

The <b>ITypeLib2</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oaidl/nn-oaidl-itypelib">ITypeLib</a> interface. This allows <b>ITypeLib</b> to cast to an <b>ITypeLib2</b> in performance-sensitive cases, rather than perform extra QueryInterface and Release calls.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">ITypeLib2</b> interface inherits from <b>ITypeLib</b>. <b>ITypeLib2</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>
