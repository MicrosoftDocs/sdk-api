<td width="60%">
Optionally specifies a handle to a directory obtained by a preceding call to 
        <b>NtCreateFile</b>. If this value is 
        <b>NULL</b>, the <b>ObjectName</b> member must be a fully qualified 
        file specification that includes the full path to the target file. If this value is 
        non-<b>NULL</b>, the <b>ObjectName</b> member specifies a file name 
        relative to this directory.

        the directory specified by <b>RootDirectory</b>. For example, \Device\Floppy1\myfile.dat 
        or \??\B:\myfile.dat could be the fully qualified file specification, provided that the floppy driver and 
        overlying file system are already loaded. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/naming-a-file">File Names, Paths, and Namespaces</a>.

Optionally specifies a security descriptor to be applied to a file. ACLs specified by such a security 
        descriptor are applied to the file only when it is created. If the value is <b>NULL</b> when a file is created, the 
        ACL placed on the file is file-system-dependent; most file systems propagate some part of such an ACL from the

### -param IoStatusBlock [out]

A pointer to a variable that receives the final completion status and information about the requested 
      operation. On return from <b>NtCreateFile</b>, the 
      <b>Information</b> member contains one of the following values:
      

<ul>
<li><b>FILE_CREATED</b></li>
<li><b>FILE_OPENED</b></li>
<li><b>FILE_OVERWRITTEN</b></li>

The initial allocation size in bytes for the file. A nonzero value has no effect unless the file is being 
      created, overwritten, or superseded.


### -param FileAttributes [in]

The file attributes. Explicitly specified attributes are applied only when the file is created, superseded, 
      or, in some cases, overwritten. By default, this value is a <b>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL</b>, 
      which can be overridden by an ORed combination of one or more 
      <b>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_</b><i>xxxx</i> flags, which are defined in Wdm.h and 
      NtDdk.h. For a list of flags that can be used with 
      <b>NtCreateFile</b>, see

## -returns



<b>NtCreateFile</b> returns either 
      <b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b> or an appropriate error status. If it returns an error status, the 
      caller can find more information about the cause of the failure by checking the 
      <i>IoStatusBlock</i>. To simplify this check, an application can use the <b>NT_SUCCESS</b>, <b>NT_ERROR</b>, and <b>NT_WARNING</b> macros.




## -remarks



The handle, given by <b>NtCreateFile</b>, can be used by 
    subsequent calls to manipulate data within the file or the file object's state or attributes.

There are two alternate ways to specify the name of the file to be created or opened with 
     <b>NtCreateFile</b>:

<ul>
<li>As a fully qualified pathname, supplied in the <b>ObjectName</b> member of the input 
      <i>ObjectAttributes</i></li>
<li>As a pathname relative to the directory file represented by the handle in the 
      <b>RootDirectory</b> member of the input <i>ObjectAttributes</i></li>
</ul>
Certain <i>DesiredAccess</i> flags and combinations of flags have the following effects:

<ul>
<li>For a caller to synchronize an I/O completion by waiting on the returned 
      <i>FileHandle</i>, the <b>SYNCHRONIZE</b> flag must be set.</li>
<li>Passing a zero to <i>DesiredFlags</i> is not valid.</li>
<li>If only the <b>FILE_APPEND_DATA</b> and <b>SYNCHRONIZE</b> flags are 
      set, the caller can write only to the end of the file, and any offset information on writes to the file is 
      ignored. However, the file is automatically  extended as necessary for this type of write operation.</li>
<li>Setting the <b>FILE_WRITE_DATA</b> flag for a file also allows writes beyond the end of 
      the file to occur. The file is automatically extended for this type of write, as well.</li>
<li>If only the <b>FILE_EXECUTE</b> and <b>SYNCHRONIZE</b> flags are set, 
      the caller cannot directly read or write any data in the file using the returned 
      <i>FileHandle</i>, that is, all operations on the file occur through the system pager in 
      response to instruction and data accesses. </li>
</ul>
The <i>ShareAccess</i> parameter determines whether separate threads can access the same file, 
    possibly simultaneously. Provided that both file openers have the privilege to access a file in the specified 
    manner, the file can be successfully opened and shared. If the original caller of 
    <b>NtCreateFile</b> does not specify 
    <b>FILE_SHARE_READ</b>, <b>FILE_SHARE_WRITE</b>, or 
    <b>FILE_SHARE_DELETE</b>, no other open operations can be performed on the file; that is, the 
    original caller is given exclusive access to the file.

For a shared file to be successfully opened, the requested <i>DesiredAccess</i> parameter to 
     the file must be compatible with both the <i>DesiredAccess</i> and 
     <i>ShareAccess</i> specifications of all preceding opens that have not yet been released with 
     <b>NtClose</b>. That is, the <i>DesiredAccess</i> parameter 
     specified to <b>NtCreateFile</b> for a given file must not 
     conflict with the accesses that other openers of the file have disallowed.

The <i>CreateDisposition</i> value <b>FILE_SUPERSEDE</b> requires that 
     the caller have <b>DELETE</b> access to an existing file object. If so, a successful call to 
     <b>NtCreateFile</b> with 
     <b>FILE_SUPERSEDE</b> on an existing file effectively deletes that file, and then re-creates 
     it. This implies that, if the file has already been opened by another thread, it opened the file by specifying a 
     <i>ShareAccess</i> parameter with the <b>FILE_SHARE_DELETE</b> flag set. 
     Note that this type of disposition is consistent with the POSIX style of overwriting files. The 
     <i>CreateDisposition</i> values <b>FILE_OVERWRITE_IF</b> and 
     <b>FILE_SUPERSEDE</b> are similar. If <b>ZwCreateFile</b> is called 
     with an existing file and either of these <i>CreateDisposition</i> values, the file is 
     replaced.

Overwriting a file is semantically equivalent to a supersede operation, except for the following:

<ul>
<li>The caller must have write access to the file, rather than delete access. This implies that, if the file 
      has already been opened by another thread, it opened the file with the 
      <b>FILE_SHARE_WRITE</b> flag set in the input <i>ShareAccess</i> 
      parameter.</li>
<li>The specified file attributes are logically ORed with those already on the file. This implies that, if the 
      file has already been opened by another thread, a subsequent caller of 
      <b>NtCreateFile</b> cannot disable existing 
      <i>FileAttributes</i> flags but can enable additional flags for the same file. Note that this 
      style of overwriting files is consistent with MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, and  OS/2 operating systems.</li>
</ul>
The <i>CreateOptions</i> <b>FILE_DIRECTORY_FILE</b> value specifies that the file to be created or opened is a 
     directory file. When a directory file is created, the file system creates an appropriate structure on the disk to 
     represent an empty directory for that particular file system's on-disk structure. If this option was specified 
     and the given file to be opened is not a directory file, or if the caller specified an inconsistent 
     <i>CreateOptions</i> or <i>CreateDisposition</i> value, the call to 
     <b>NtCreateFile</b> fails.

The <i>CreateOptions</i> <b>FILE_NO_INTERMEDIATE_BUFFERING</b> flag prevents the file system from performing any 
     intermediate buffering on behalf of the caller. Specifying this value places certain restrictions on the caller's 
     parameters to other <b>Nt<i>XXX</i>File</b> routines, including the 
     following:

<ul>
<li>Any optional <i>ByteOffset</i> passed to  the 
      <b>NtReadFile</b> or <b>NtWriteFile</b> function must be an 
      integral of the sector size.</li>
<li>The <i>Length</i> passed to <b>NtReadFile</b> or 
      <b>NtWriteFile</b>, must be an integral of the sector size. Note that specifying a 
      read operation to a buffer whose length is exactly the sector size might result in a lesser number of 
      significant bytes being transferred to that buffer if the end of the file was reached during the transfer.</li>
<li>Buffers must be adjusted in accordance with the alignment requirement of the underlying device. This 
      information can be obtained by calling <b>NtCreateFile</b> 
      to get a handle for the file object that represents the physical device, and then calling 
      <b>NtQueryInformationFile</b> with that handle. For a list of the system 
       <b>FILE_</b><i>XXX</i><b>_ALIGNMENT</b> values, see 
       the Windows SDK documentation.</li>
<li>Calls to <b>NtSetInformationFile</b> with the 
      <i>FileInformationClass</i> parameter set to 
      <b>FilePositionInformation</b> must specify an offset that is an integral of the 
      sector size.</li>
</ul>
The <i>CreateOptions</i> <b>FILE_SYNCHRONOUS_IO_ALERT</b> and <b>FILE_SYNCHRONOUS_IO_NONALERT</b> flags, 
     which are mutually exclusive as their names suggest, specify that all I/O operations on the file are to be 
     synchronous as long as they occur through the file object referred to by the returned 
     <i>FileHandle</i>. All I/O on such a file is serialized across all threads using the returned 
     handle. With either of these <i>CreateOptions</i>, the <i>DesiredAccess</i> <b>SYNCHRONIZE</b> flag must be set so that the I/O Manager  uses the 
     file object as a synchronization object. With either of these <i>CreateOptions</i> set, the 
     I/O Manager maintains the "file position context" for the file object, an internal, current file position offset. 
     This offset can be used in calls to <b>NtReadFile</b> and 
     <b>NtWriteFile</b>. Its position also can be queried or set with 
     <b>NtQueryInformationFile</b> and 
     <b>NtSetInformationFile</b>.

If the <i>CreateOptions</i> parameter specifies the <b>FILE_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT</b> flag and <b>NtCreateFile</b> opens a file with a reparse point, normal reparse processing does not occur and <b>NtCreateFile</b> attempts to directly open the reparse point file. If the <b>FILE_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT</b> flag is not specified, normal reparse point processing occurs for the file. In either case, if the open operation was successful, <b>NtCreateFile</b> returns <b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b>; otherwise, an error code. The <b>NtCreateFile</b> function never returns <b>STATUS_REPARSE</b>.

The <i>CreateOptions</i> parameter's <b>FILE_OPEN_REQUIRING_OPLOCK</b> flag eliminates the time between when you open the file and request an oplock that could potentially allow a third party to open the file, which would cause a sharing violation. An application can use the <b>FILE_OPEN_REQUIRING_OPLOCK</b> flag with <b>NtCreateFile</b> and then request any oplock. This ensures that an oplock owner will be notified of any subsequent open request that causes a sharing violation. 

In Windows 7, if other handles exist on the file when an application uses this flag, the create operation will fail with <b>STATUS_OPLOCK_NOT_GRANTED</b>. This restriction no longer exists starting with Windows 8.

If this create operation would break an oplock that already exists on the file, then setting the <b>FILE_OPEN_REQUIRING_OPLOCK</b> flag will cause the create operation to fail with <b>STATUS_CANNOT_BREAK_OPLOCK</b>. The existing oplock will not be broken by this create operation.

An application that uses this flag must request an oplock after this call succeeds, or all subsequent attempts to open the file will be blocked without the benefit of normal oplock processing. Similarly, if this call succeeds but the subsequent oplock request fails, an application that uses this flag must close its handle after it detects that the oplock request has failed.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The <b>FILE_OPEN_REQUIRING_OPLOCK</b> flag is available in Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 and later operating systems for the following file systems: NTFS, FAT, and exFAT.
</div>
<div> </div>



The <i>CreateOptions</i> parameter's <b>FILE_RESERVE_OPFILTER</b> flag allows an application to request a Level 1, Batch, or Filter oplock to prevent other applications from getting share violations. However, in practical terms, the <b>FILE_RESERVE_OPFILTER</b> is useful only for filter oplocks. To use it, you must complete the following steps:



<ol>
<li>Issue a create request with <i>CreateOptions</i> of <b>FILE_RESERVE_OPFILTER</b>, <i>DesiredAccess</i> of exactly <b>FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES</b>, and <i>ShareAccess</i> of exactly <code>(FILE_SHARE_READ | FILE_SHARE_WRITE | FILE_SHARE_DELETE)</code>. Possible failures are as follows:<ul>
<li>If there are already open handles, the create request fails with <b>STATUS_OPLOCK_NOT_GRANTED</b>, and the next requested oplock also fails. </li>
<li>If you open with more access than <b>FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES</b>  or less sharing than <code>(FILE_SHARE_READ | FILE_SHARE_WRITE | FILE_SHARE_DELETE)</code>, the request  fails with <b>STATUS_OPLOCK_NOT_GRANTED</b>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the create request succeeds, request an oplock.</li>
<li>Open another handle to the file to do I/O.</li>
</ol>Step three makes this practical only for filter oplocks. The handle opened in step three can have a <i>DesiredAccess</i> that contains a maximum of <code>(FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES | FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES | FILE_READ_DATA | FILE_READ_EA | FILE_EXECUTE | SYNCHRONIZE | READ_CONTROL)</code> and still not break a filter oplock. However, any <i>DesiredAccess</i> greater than <code>(FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES | FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES | SYNCHRONIZE)</code> will break a Level 1 or Batch oplock and make the <b>FILE_RESERVE_OPFILTER</b> flag useless for those oplock types.
