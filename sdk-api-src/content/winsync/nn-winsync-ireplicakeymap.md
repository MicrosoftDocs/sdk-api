# IReplicaKeyMap interface


## -description

Represents a mapping between replica keys and replica IDs.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IReplicaKeyMap</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IReplicaKeyMap</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

Because replica IDs repeatedly occur in the metadata for a replica and are suggested to be 16-byte GUIDs, Windows Sync represents replica IDs by using a map between replica IDs to 4-byte replica keys. Windows Sync then uses replica keys where references to particular replicas are required.
