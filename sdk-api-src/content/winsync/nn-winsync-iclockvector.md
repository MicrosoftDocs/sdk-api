# IClockVector interface


## -description

Represents a clock vector in a knowledge structure.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IClockVector</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IClockVector</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

A clock vector defines the changes that are contained in a knowledge structure by using a list of <b>IClockVectorElement</b> objects. An <b>IClockVectorElement</b> object exists for each replica that has made a change that is contained in the knowledge. A change that is made by a particular replica is defined to be contained in the knowledge when the tick count for the change occurs between zero and the tick count contained in <b>IClockVectorElement</b> that tracks that replica.
