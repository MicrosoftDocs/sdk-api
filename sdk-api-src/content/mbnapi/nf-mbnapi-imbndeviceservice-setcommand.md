## -remarks



<b>SetCommand</b> exists to implement vendor-specific device service functionality which is not otherwise covered in the Mobile Broadband API. A command session on a device service must be opened before the application can call <b>SetCommand</b>.

The Mobile Broadband service will issue a <b>SET</b> request to the device. <i>deviceServiceData</i> will be copied byte-by-byte into the data buffer passed in to the request. This data buffer must be less than <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mbnapi/nf-mbnapi-imbndeviceservicescontext-get_maxcommandsize">MaxCommandSize</a> bytes.

This is an asynchronous operation and <b>SetCommand</b> will return immediately. On completion of the operation, the Mobile Broadband service will call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mbnapi/nf-mbnapi-imbndeviceservicesevents-onsetcommandcomplete">OnSetCommandComplete</a> method of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mbnapi/nn-mbnapi-imbndeviceservicesevents">IMbnDeviceServicesEvents</a> interface.
