Notification method indicating that a device service <b>SET</b> request has completed.


## -parameters




### -param deviceService [in]

The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mbnapi/nn-mbnapi-imbndeviceservice">IMbnDeviceService</a> object on which the operation was requested.


### -param responseID [in]

An identifier for the response.


### -param deviceServiceData [in]

A byte array containing the data returned by the device. If the response is fragmented across multiple indications, this only contains the information for one fragment. This field is valid only if the status is <b>S_OK</b>.


### -param status [in]

A status code that indicates the outcome of the operation.


### -param requestID [in]

The request ID that was assigned by the Mobile Broadband service to the set operation request.


## -returns



The method must return the following value.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method completed successfully.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



The <i>deviceServiceData</i> byte array contains the byte-by-byte copy of data returned by the device. The Mobile Broadband service will free the memory after the function call returns. If an application wants to use this data then it should copy the contents in its own memory.
