# IMbnDeviceServicesEvents interface


## -description

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting in Windows 10, version 1803, the Win32 APIs described in this section are replaced by the Windows Runtime APIs in the [Windows.Networking.Connectivity](/uwp/api/windows.networking.connectivity) namespace.

Signals an application about notification events related to Mobile Broadband device services on the system.

## -inheritance

The <b>IMbnDeviceServicesEvents</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IMbnDeviceServicesEvents</b> also has these types of members:

## -remarks

The following procedure describes how to register for notifications.<ol>
<li>Get an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nn-ocidl-iconnectionpoint">IConnectionPoint</a> interface by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-queryinterface(q)">QueryInterface</a> on an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mbnapi/nn-mbnapi-imbndeviceservicesmanager">IMbnDeviceServicesManager</a> object.</li>
<li>Call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nf-ocidl-iconnectionpointcontainer-findconnectionpoint">FindConnectionPoint</a> on the returned interface and pass IID_IMbnDeviceServicesEvents to RIID.</li>
<li>Call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nf-ocidl-iconnectionpoint-advise">Advise</a> on the returned connection point and pass a pointer to an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface on an object that implements <b>IMbnDeviceServicesEvents</b> to PUNK.</li>
</ol>


Notifications can be terminated by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nf-ocidl-iconnectionpoint-unadvise">Unadvise</a> on the connection point returned in step 2.
