# IWMDMStorage4::SetReferences


## -description



The <b>SetReferences</b> method sets the references contained in a storage that has references (such as a playlist or album), overwriting any previously existing references held by the storage.




## -parameters




### -param dwRefs [in]

Count of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mswmdm/nn-mswmdm-iwmdmstorage">IWMDMStorage</a> interface pointers in <i>ppIWMDMStorage</i>. Zero is an acceptable value and clears all references from the storage. The storage itself is not deleted in this case.


### -param ppIWMDMStorage [in]

Pointer to an array of <b>IWMDMStorage</b> interface pointers to be referenced by the storage. This order is preserved by the storage. <b>NULL</b> is an acceptable value if <i>dwRefs</i> is also zero. The caller is responsible for allocating and releasing this array.


## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. All the interface methods in Windows Media Device Manager can return any of the following classes of error codes:

<ul>
<li>Standard COM error codes </li>
<li>Windows error codes converted to HRESULT values </li>
<li>Windows Media Device Manager error codes </li>
</ul>
For an extensive list of possible error codes, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WMDM/error-codes">Error Codes</a>.




## -remarks



This method is used to set references in objects that are composed of references, such as playlists or albums. If a device does not support metadata, this method will probably not be supported.

Any valid <b>IWMDMStorage</b> object can be contained in the <i>ppIWMDMStorage</i> array. This includes folders and other storages specifying references themselves (creating, for example, a playlist of playlists). The device itself determines how any particular case of referent object is handled. Windows Media Device Manager does not enforce any rules beyond that of <b>IWMDMStorage</b> validity. Consider the case of a playlist containing nested playlist references. On one device, this is disallowed and <b>SetReferences</b> fails. On another device, this is allowed; playback simply traverses the entire set of contained references in depth-first order.

The situation may arise where an <b>IWMDMStorage4</b> interface pointer corresponds to a storage that no longer exists on the device. WMDM_E_INTERFACEDEAD is returned in this case.
