# IWMDeviceManager interface


## -description

The <b>IWMDeviceManager</b> interface is the top level Windows Media Device Manager interface for applications. This is the first interface accessed by an application, and is used to acquire the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mswmdm/nn-mswmdm-iwmdmenumdevice">IWMDMEnumDevice</a> interface used to enumerate the connected devices. This interface is obtained by calling <b>QueryInterface</b> on the authenticated <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mswmdm/nn-mswmdm-icomponentauthenticate">IComponentAuthenticate</a> interface. If the device supports it, use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mswmdm/nn-mswmdm-iwmdevicemanager2">IWMDeviceManager2</a> interface, which offers superior device enumeration capabilities.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IWMDeviceManager</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IWMDeviceManager</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>
