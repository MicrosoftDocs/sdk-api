## -remarks



This call returns status values specific to the device control operations of this interface. The control status can provide information about the state of control-related activities of the device, such as playing, recording, and so on. However, it cannot provide information about the global status of the device, such as whether the device is downloading data or being accessed for some other reason. If the device is busy for any reason other than device control, you receive a busy code and must call the <b>GetStatus</b> method of the associated <b>IMDSPDevice</b> interface for more detailed information.

You must not attempt to call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mswmdm/nf-mswmdm-imdspdevicecontrol-play">Play</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mswmdm/nf-mswmdm-imdspdevicecontrol-record">Record</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mswmdm/nf-mswmdm-imdspdevicecontrol-pause">Pause</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mswmdm/nf-mswmdm-imdspdevicecontrol-resume">Resume</a>, or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mswmdm/nf-mswmdm-imdspdevicecontrol-stop">Stop</a> methods of this interface if the status value WMDM_STATUS_BUSY is returned and the status value does not contain any other values from the table of status values.
