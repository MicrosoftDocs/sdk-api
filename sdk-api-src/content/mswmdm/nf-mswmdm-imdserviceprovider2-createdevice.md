# IMDServiceProvider2::CreateDevice


## -description



The <b>CreateDevice</b> method is called by the Windows Media Device Manager to get the <b>IMDSPDevice</b> object(s) corresponding to the canonical device obtained from the PnP subsystem. This method must be implemented for PnP and Windows Explorer support, but otherwise it is optional. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WMDM/mandatory-and-optional-interfaces">Mandatory and Optional Interfaces</a>.




## -parameters




### -param pwszDevicePath [in]

Pointer to a wide-character null-terminated string containing the device path of the device detected by Windows Media Device Manager. This name is obtained from the PnP subsystem, and is the canonical name plus "$ <i>#</i> ", where <i>#</i> is an auto-incremented number. This name can be passed directly to functions such as <b>CreateFile</b> to gain access to the underlying kernel device object. The service provider should create a wrapper <b>IMDSPDevice</b> object(s) for this device.


### -param pdwCount [out]

Pointer to a <b>DWORD</b> containing the number of <b>IMDSPDevice</b> objects that are created.


### -param pppDeviceArray [out]

An array of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mswmdm/nn-mswmdm-imdspdevice">IMDSPDevice</a> interfaces representing the devices. Typically, there is only one array element, but a service provider can create more than one <b>IMDSPDevice</b> object corresponding to a device path name if it creates an <b>IMDSPDevice</b> object for each top-level storage. This is subject to change in the future, and the count may be restricted to 1.


## -returns



If the method succeeds it returns S_OK. If the method fails, it returns the Windows Media Device Manager error codes.




## -remarks



Windows Media Device Manager calls this method when an application starts, or when a Plug and Play compliant device connects with the computer.
