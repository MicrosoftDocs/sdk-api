# IWMDMDeviceControl::GetCapabilities


## -description



The <b>GetCapabilities</b> method retrieves the device capabilities to determine what operations the device can perform. The capabilities describe the methods of the device control that are supported by the media device.




## -parameters




### -param pdwCapabilitiesMask [out]

Pointer to a <b>DWORD</b> specifying the capabilities of the device. The following flags can be returned in this variable.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag
                </th>
<th>Description
                </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_DEVICECAP_CANPLAY</td>
<td>The media device can play MP3 audio.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_DEVICECAP_CANSTREAMPLAY</td>
<td>The media device can play streaming audio directly from the host computer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_DEVICECAP_CANRECORD</td>
<td>The media device can record audio.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_DEVICECAP_CANSTREAMRECORD</td>
<td>The media device can record streaming audio directly to the host computer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_DEVICECAP_CANPAUSE</td>
<td>The media device can pause during play or record operations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_DEVICECAP_CANRESUME</td>
<td>The media device can resume an operation that was paused.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_DEVICECAP_CANSTOP</td>
<td>The media device can stop playing before the end of a file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_DEVICECAP_CANSEEK</td>
<td>The media device can seek to a position other than the beginning of a file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_DEVICECAP_HASSECURECLOCK</td>
<td>The media device has a secure clock.</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>

</table>
 




## -remarks



Currently, not many devices report their capabilities correctly.


#### Examples

The following C++ code retrieves the device capabilities.


```cpp

// Examine the device capabilities.
// Use some of these to enable or disable the application's
// user interface elements.
CComQIPtr<IWMDMDeviceControl> pDeviceControl(pIWMDMDevice);
if (pDeviceControl != NULL)
{
    DWORD caps = 0;
    hr = pDeviceControl->GetCapabilities(&caps);
    if (caps & WMDM_DEVICECAP_CANPLAY)
    {
        // TODO: Display a message indicating that the media device can play MP3 audio.
    }
    if (caps & WMDM_DEVICECAP_CANSTREAMPLAY)
    {
        // TODO: Display a message that the device can play audio directly from the host computer.
    }
    if (caps & WMDM_DEVICECAP_CANRECORD)
    {
        // TODO: Display a message that the device can record audio.
    }
    if (caps & WMDM_DEVICECAP_CANSTREAMRECORD)
    {
        // TODO: Display a message that the media device can record 
        // streaming audio directly to the host computer.
    }
    if (caps & WMDM_DEVICECAP_CANPAUSE)
    {
        // TODO: Display a message that the device can pause during play or record operations.
    }
    if (caps & WMDM_DEVICECAP_CANRESUME)
    {
        // TODO: Display a message that the device can resume an operation that was paused.
    }
    if (caps & WMDM_DEVICECAP_CANSTOP)
    {
        // TODO: Display a message that the device can stop playing before the end of a file.
    }
    if (caps & WMDM_DEVICECAP_CANSEEK)
    {
        // TODO: Display a message that the device can seek to a position 
        // other than the beginning of the file.
    }
    if (caps & WMDM_DEVICECAP_HASSECURECLOCK)
    {
        // TODO: Display a message indicating that the device has a secure clock.
    }
}
