# IWMDMProgress::End


## -description



The <b>End</b> method indicates that an operation is finished.




## -parameters






## -returns



The return value from the method is ignored by Windows Media Device Manager.




## -remarks



This method is called by various interfaces to indicate that an operation is ending. Windows Media Device Manager ignores any return code returned by the <b>End</b> method because the operation is completed or terminated before this method is called.


#### Examples

The following C++ code is an implementation of the <b>End</b> method


```cpp

HRESULT End()
{
    // TODO: Display the message: "IWMDMProgress::End called."
    return S_OK; // Unnecessary, since this is ignored.
}

```
