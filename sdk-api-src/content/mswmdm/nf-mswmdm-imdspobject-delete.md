# IMDSPObject::Delete


## -description



The <b>Delete</b> method removes an object or objects from a storage medium on a media device.




## -parameters




### -param fuMode [in]

Flag that must always be set to WMDM_MODE_RECURSIVE by the client. If the object is a folder, it and its contents, and all subfolders and their contents are deleted. If the object is a file, this parameter is ignored.


### -param pProgress [in]

Pointer to an application-implemented <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mswmdm/nn-mswmdm-iwmdmprogress">IWMDMProgress</a> interface that enables the application to receive progress notifications for lengthy <b>Delete</b> operations.


## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. All the interface methods in Windows Media Device Manager can return any of the following classes of error codes:

<ul>
<li>Standard COM error codes </li>
<li>Windows error codes converted to HRESULT values </li>
<li>Windows Media Device Manager error codes </li>
</ul>
For an extensive list of possible error codes, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WMDM/error-codes">Error Codes</a>.




## -remarks



This method permanently removes the object(s) from the storage medium.

When using a CompactFlash card reader/writer with Windows Media Device Manager service provider, calling <b>IMDSPObject::Delete</b> immediately after <b>IMDSPObject::Write</b> sometimes fails. This happens because data written to a CompactFlash reader/writer is buffered by the driver of the card reader/writer. The service provider responds as if the write operations are finished, but the driver writes them out to the device according to its own schedule. <b>IMDSPObject::Delete</b> fails if the driver has not finished its writing operation.

This method must be implemented. It must not return WMDM_E_NOTSUPPORTED or E_NOTIMPL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WMDM/mandatory-and-optional-interfaces">Mandatory and Optional Interfaces</a>.
