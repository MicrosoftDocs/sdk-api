# IWMDMOperation::BeginWrite


## -description



The <b>BeginWrite</b> method indicates that a "write to device" action is beginning. Windows Media Device Manager only calls this method if the application calls <b>IWMDMStorageControl/2/3::Insert/2/3</b> and passes in this interface.




## -parameters






## -returns



The application should return one of the following <b>HRESULT</b> values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The read operation should continue.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>WMDM_E_USER_CANCELLED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The read operation should be cancelled without finishing.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_FAIL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
An unspecified error occurred, and the read operation should be cancelled without finishing.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



This method is called just before the Windows Media Device Manager calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mswmdm/nf-mswmdm-iwmdmoperation-transferobjectdata">IWMDMOperation::TransferObjectData</a> to begin writing data to the device.


#### Examples

The following C++ code example implements the <b>BeginWrite</b> method and outputs a message when a write-to-device action is beginning.


```cpp

HRESULT BeginWrite()
{
    // TODO: Display the message: "IWMDMOperation event--BeginWrite."
    
    // If the global handle of the destination file is uninitialized, fail.
    if (m_File == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)
        return E_FAIL;

    // Global status to let TransferObjectData know what kind of
    // operation is happening.
    m_OperationStatus = OPERATION_WRITE;
    return S_OK;
}

```
