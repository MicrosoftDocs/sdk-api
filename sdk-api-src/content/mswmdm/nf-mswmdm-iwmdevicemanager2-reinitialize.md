# IWMDeviceManager2::Reinitialize


## -description



The <b>Reinitialize</b> method forces Windows Media Device Manager to rediscover all the Windows Media Device Manager devices.




## -parameters






## -returns



If the method succeeds, it returns S_OK. If it fails, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



Windows Media Device Manager monitors Plug and Play (PnP) notifications to keep track of connected devices which are controlled by a PnP-compliant service provider. If a non-compliant device is plugged in or some other changes are made to a device for which the device does not generate PnP notifications (for example, insertion or removal of a storage card), the application should call this method before calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mswmdm/nf-mswmdm-iwmdevicemanager2-enumdevices2">IWMDeviceManager2::EnumDevices2</a>. The application would typically do this on a refresh request from the user.
