## -remarks



This method is identical to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mswmdm/nf-mswmdm-iscpsecureexchange-transfercomplete">ISCPSecureExchange::TransferComplete</a> except that this method is called when transfer is completed within a transfer session.

In that case, the secure content provider needs to know which device the transfer was completed for, so this method accepts a <i>pDevice</i> parameter.
