# IMDSPStorageGlobals::GetCapabilities


## -description



The <b>GetCapabilities</b> method retrieves the capabilities of the storage medium that an instance of this interface is associated with.




## -parameters




### -param pdwCapabilities [out]

Pointer to a <b>DWORD</b> containing the capabilities of the storage medium.

The following flags can be returned in the <i>pdwCapabilities</i> parameter.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag
                </th>
<th>Description
                </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_STORAGECAP_FOLDERSINROOT</td>
<td>The medium supports folders in the root of storage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_STORAGECAP_FILESINROOT</td>
<td>The medium supports files in the root of storage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_STORAGECAP_FOLDERSINFOLDERS</td>
<td>The medium supports folders in folders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_STORAGECAP_FILESINFOLDERS</td>
<td>The medium supports files in folders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_STORAGECAP_FOLDERLIMITEXISTS</td>
<td>There is an arbitrary count limit for the number of folders allowed per the form of folder support by the medium.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_STORAGECAP_FILELIMITEXISTS</td>
<td>There is an arbitrary count limit for the number of files allowed per the form of file support by the medium.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_STORAGECAP_NOT_INITIALIZABLE</td>
<td>The medium cannot be initialized. By default, the top-level storage can be initialized.</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

For secured device implementations, the following flags describing the rights capabilities of the medium can also be returned.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag
                </th>
<th>Description
                </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_RIGHTS_PLAYBACKCOUNT</td>
<td>The medium supports playback count limiting for content.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_RIGHTS_EXPIRATIONDATE</td>
<td>The medium supports expiration date tracking for content.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_RIGHTS_FREESERIALIDS</td>
<td>The medium supports a free serial identifier for the file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_RIGHTS_GROUPID</td>
<td>The medium supports a group identifier for the file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_RIGHTS_NAMEDSERIALIDS</td>
<td>The medium supports a named serial identifier for the file.</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. All the interface methods in Windows Media Device Manager can return any of the following classes of error codes:

<ul>
<li>Standard COM error codes </li>
<li>Windows error codes converted to HRESULT values </li>
<li>Windows Media Device Manager error codes </li>
</ul>
For an extensive list of possible error codes, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WMDM/error-codes">Error Codes</a>.




## -remarks



Attempts to perform unsupported operations on the storage medium with the <b>IMDSPObject</b> interface return an error code. The <b>GetCapabilities</b> method can be called in order to determine whether an operation can be expected to succeed under normal circumstances.

If either the WMDM_STORAGECAP_FILELIMITEXISTS flag or the WMDM_STORAGECAP_FOLDERLIMITEXISTS flag is true, there are arbitrary limits on the number of files or folders that can be created. Operations through the <b>IMDSPObject</b> interface that exceed these limits will fail.

This method must be implemented. It must not return WMDM_E_NOTSUPPORTED or E_NOTIMPL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WMDM/mandatory-and-optional-interfaces">Mandatory and Optional Interfaces</a>.
