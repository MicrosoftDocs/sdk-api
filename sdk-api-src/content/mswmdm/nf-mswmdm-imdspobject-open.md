# IMDSPObject::Open


## -description



The <b>Open</b> method opens the associated object and prepares it for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mswmdm/nf-mswmdm-imdspobject-read">Read</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mswmdm/nf-mswmdm-imdspobject-write">Write</a> operations. This operation is valid only if the storage object represents a file.




## -parameters




### -param fuMode [in]

Mode in which the file must be opened. It must be one of the following two values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value
                </th>
<th>Description
                </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MDSP_READ</td>
<td>Query whether a subsequent call to <b>Read</b> would be allowed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MDSP_WRITE</td>
<td>Query whether a subsequent call to <b>Insert</b> would be allowed.</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. All the interface methods in Windows Media Device Manager can return any of the following classes of error codes:

<ul>
<li>Standard COM error codes </li>
<li>Windows error codes converted to HRESULT values </li>
<li>Windows Media Device Manager error codes </li>
</ul>
For an extensive list of possible error codes, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WMDM/error-codes">Error Codes</a>.




## -remarks



If the underlying file-system does not support opening of multiple files at the same time, the service provider should gracefully the return Win32 error code ERROR_TOO_MANY_OPEN_FILES, if the client attempts to open more than one file at a time.

This method must be implemented. It must not return WMDM_E_NOTSUPPORTED or E_NOTIMPL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WMDM/mandatory-and-optional-interfaces">Mandatory and Optional Interfaces</a>.
