# IWMDMOperation::End


## -description



The <b>End</b> method indicates that a read or write operation is finished, whether successful or not, and it returns a completion code.




## -parameters




### -param phCompletionCode [in]

Completion code for the operation.


### -param pNewObject [in]

When sending to a device, a pointer to a new <b>IWMDMStorage</b> object representing the new object that has been sent to the device. When reading from a device, a pointer to the <b>IWMDMStorage</b> object that was read from the device.


## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. All the interface methods in Windows Media Device Manager can return any of the following classes of error codes:

<ul>
<li>Standard COM error codes </li>
<li>Windows error codes converted to HRESULT values </li>
<li>Windows Media Device Manager error codes </li>
</ul>
For an extensive list of possible error codes, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WMDM/error-codes">Error Codes</a>.




## -remarks



The <b>End</b> method is called whether or not the transfer was successful, and is the last <b>IWMDMOperation</b> method called. This method can be used to signal the application to close all file handles and other objects required by the read or write operation.


#### Examples

The following C++ code closes a global file handle after a read or write action, and outputs a message.


```cpp

HRESULT End(HRESULT* phCompletionCode, IUnknown* pNewObject)
{
    // TODO: Display the message: "IWMDMOperation event--End."

    // Close the file handle now that we're done with it.
    if (m_File != INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)
        if (!CloseHandle(m_File))
            // TODO: Display the message: "Couldn't close the file."

    // Reset global status flag.
    m_OperationStatus = OPERATION_UNINITIALIZED;
    return S_OK;
}

```
