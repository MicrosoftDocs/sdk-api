# IWMDMNotification::WMDMMessage


## -description



The <b>WMDMMessage</b> method is a callback method implemented by a client, and called by Windows Media Device Manager when a Plug and Play compliant device or storage medium is connected or removed.




## -parameters




### -param dwMessageType [in]

A <b>DWORD</b> specifying the message type.

The possible values for the event types are the following:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Message type
                </th>
<th>Description
                </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_MSG_DEVICE_ARRIVAL</td>
<td>A device has been connected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_MSG_DEVICE_REMOVAL</td>
<td>A device has been removed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_MSG_MEDIA_ARRIVAL</td>
<td>A storage medium has been inserted in a connected device.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WMDM_MSG_MEDIA_REMOVAL</td>
<td>A storage medium has been removed from a connected device.</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -param pwszCanonicalName [in]

Pointer to a wide-character, null-terminated string specifying the canonical name of the device for which this event is generated. The application does not release this value.


## -returns



The return value is an <b>HRESULT</b> in which application can return results of its processing of the message. The return value is ignored by WMDM.




## -remarks



To learn how an application subscribes to receive notifications through this method, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WMDM/enabling-notifications">Enabling Notifications</a>.


#### Examples

The following C++ code implements the <b>WMDMMessage</b> method, and prints out a device or storage arrival or departure notification message.


```cpp

HRESULT WMDMMessage(DWORD  dwMessageType, LPCWSTR  pwszCanonicalName)
{
    switch(dwMessageType)
    {
    case WMDM_MSG_DEVICE_ARRIVAL:
        // TODO: Display a message indicating that a new device has been detected and display the device name.
        break;
    case WMDM_MSG_DEVICE_REMOVAL:
        // TODO: Display a message that the device has been removed and display the device name.
        break;
    case WMDM_MSG_MEDIA_ARRIVAL:
        // TODO: Display a message indicating that storage media has been added to the device and display the device name.
        break;
    case WMDM_MSG_MEDIA_REMOVAL:
        // TODO: Display a message that storage media has been removed from the device and display the device name.
        break;
    default:
        // TODO: Display a message indicating that an unidentified message has been received.
        break;
    }
    return S_OK; // Return value is ignored, and not returned to the application.
}

```
