# IMDSPDeviceControl interface


## -description

The <b>IMDSPDeviceControl</b> interface provides methods for controlling devices. After this interface is acquired from a specific instance of the <b>IMDSPDevice</b> interface, the control methods are used for remote control of streaming audio play, record, pause, stop, and seek operations on that device. Implementing this interface is optional. For more information, see <a href="/windows/desktop/WMDM/mandatory-and-optional-interfaces">Mandatory and Optional Interfaces</a>.

The <b>IMDSPDeviceControl</b> interface methods support several modes of audio control, depending on the context in which they are used. That context is defined by the <b>Seek</b> method. The <b>GetCapabilities</b> method is used to determine what kinds of operations can be performed by the device.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IMDSPDeviceControl</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IMDSPDeviceControl</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>
