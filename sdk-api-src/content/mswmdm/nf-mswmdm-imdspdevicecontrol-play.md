# IMDSPDeviceControl::Play


## -description



The <b>Play</b> method begins playing at the current seek position. If the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mswmdm/nf-mswmdm-imdspdevicecontrol-seek">Seek</a> method has not been called, then playing begins at the beginning of the first file, and the play length is not defined.




## -parameters






## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

## -remarks



This method is used to invoke both device playback (playback of an audio track on a storage medium of the media device) and streaming audio playback (streaming audio data from the user's computer to the media device, where it is played). The <b>Seek</b> method determines the form of playback that occurs.

Some devices do not support either device playback or streaming audio playback. Before attempting to start playback of a particular type, the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mswmdm/nf-mswmdm-imdspdevicecontrol-getcapabilities">GetCapabilities</a> method must be called. If unsupported playback is attempted, this method returns WMDM_E_NOTSUPPORTED.

To determine whether an audio format can be played by the media device before invoking the play operation, you can call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mswmdm/nf-mswmdm-imdspdevice-getformatsupport">IMDSPDevice::GetFormatSupport</a> method.
