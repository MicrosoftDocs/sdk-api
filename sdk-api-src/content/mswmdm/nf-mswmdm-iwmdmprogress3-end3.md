# IWMDMProgress3::End3


## -description



The <b>End3</b> method is called by Windows Media Device Manager to indicate that an operation has finished. This method extends <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mswmdm/nf-mswmdm-iwmdmprogress2-end2">IWMDMProgress2::End2</a> by providing additional input parameters for the identification (ID) of the event and for a pointer to the context of the commands.




## -parameters




### -param EventId [in]

A <b>GUID</b> specifying the event that is ending. Possible values are shown in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Event
                </th>
<th>Description
                </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCP_EVENTID_ACQSECURECLOCK</td>
<td>Windows Media Device Manager is acquiring a secure clock from server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCP_EVENTID_NEEDTOINDIV</td>
<td>The device is being individualized. This is not currently used.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCP_EVENTID_DRMINFO</td>
<td>
This event ID is used to notify the application with the version DRM header found in the content for each file.

The OPAQUECOMMAND structure returned has the <b>guidCommand</b> member set to SCP_PARAMID_DRMVERSION.

In addition, the data specifies one of the following flags:

WMDM_SCP_DRMINFO_NOT_DRMPROTECTED

WMDM_SCP_DRMINFO_V1HEADER

WMDM_SCP_DRMINFO_V2HEADER

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>EVENT_WMDM_CONTENT_TRANSFER</td>
<td>Content is being transferred to or from the device.</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -param hrCompletionCode [in]

<b>HRESULT</b> specifying the completion code of the operation that was in progress. The <i>hrCompletionCode</i> parameter is the return code of the operation that ended. This parameter can be any <b>HRESULT</b>, including standard COM error codes, Win32 error codes converted to <b>HRESULT</b>, or Windows Media Device Manager error codes.


### -param pContext [in, out]

Pointer to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WMDM/opaquecommand">OPAQUECOMMAND</a> structure containing a command sent directly to the device without being handled by Windows Media Device Manager. This parameter is optional and can be <b>NULL</b>. The context structure is a way for the component to send any relevant data with the event to the application. The component sending this structure should define how the application can interpret this data structure.




## -returns



Windows Media Device Manager ignores any return code returned by the <b>End3</b> method because the current operation is finished or cancelled before this method is called.




## -remarks



The interface that owns the method that is implementing an operation calls <b>End3</b> when the operation defined by the method is completed.


#### Examples

The following C++ code shows an example implementation of <b>End3</b>.


```cpp

HRESULT End3(GUID  EventId, HRESULT  hrCompletionCode, OPAQUECOMMAND*  pContext)
{
    // TODO: Display the message "IWMDMProgress3::End3 called."
    return S_OK;
}

```
