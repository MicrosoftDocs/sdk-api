# IPNPXDeviceAssociation::Associate


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[Function Discovery is available for use in the operating systems specified in the Requirements section. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions.]

Marks an association database entry as associated and sends an appropriate notification.  If there is no association database entry for the function instance, one is created; otherwise the existing entry is updated. Any notification sent reflects the online presence of the device, as reported by the Plug and Play (PnP) component.


## -parameters




### -param pszSubCategory [in, optional]

The subcategory of the association database in which the entry is stored.  This parameter can be <b>NULL</b>.


### -param pIFunctionDiscoveryNotification [in]

An <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/functiondiscoveryapi/nn-functiondiscoveryapi-ifunctiondiscoverynotification">IFunctionDiscoveryNotification</a> object that is registered for notifications with Function Discovery. 


## -returns



This method can return one of these values.

## -remarks



This method modifies the association database entry corresponding to the function instance from which the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/pnpxassoc/nn-pnpxassoc-ipnpxdeviceassociation">IPNPXDeviceAssociation</a> interface was obtained. 

Once a device is associated, the PnP-X Service IP Bus Enumerator (IPBusEnum) sends a request to the PnP component  to create the device <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fundisc/function-discovery-glossary">devnode</a>. Once the devnode has been created, the appropriate notification is sent. The following logic is used to determine the callback method used for notification:

<ul>
<li>If a PnP notification is received after the device is associated, then the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/functiondiscoveryapi/nf-functiondiscoveryapi-ifunctiondiscoverynotification-onupdate">IFunctionDiscoveryNotification::OnUpdate</a> method is called  with the <i>enumQueryUpdateAction</i> parameter set to  <b>QUA_ADD</b>. </li>
<li>If no PnP notification is received after the device is associated, and there are no pending PnP events, then the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/functiondiscoveryapi/nf-functiondiscoveryapi-ifunctiondiscoverynotification-onerror">IFunctionDiscoveryNotification::OnError</a> method is called. </li>
<li>Finally, if no PnP notification is received after the device is associated, and there are pending PnP events, then no callback method is called.</li>
</ul>
The <b>Found New Hardware</b> wizard appears if user intervention is required to install a device driver after association.
