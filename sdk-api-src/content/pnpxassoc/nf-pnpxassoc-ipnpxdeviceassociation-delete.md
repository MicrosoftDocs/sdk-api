## -remarks



This method modifies the association database entry corresponding to the function instance from which the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/pnpxassoc/nn-pnpxassoc-ipnpxdeviceassociation">IPNPXDeviceAssociation</a> interface was obtained. 

The following logic is used to determine the callback method used for notification:

<ul>
<li>If a PnP notification is received after the device is deleted, then the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/functiondiscoveryapi/nf-functiondiscoveryapi-ifunctiondiscoverynotification-onupdate">IFunctionDiscoveryNotification::OnUpdate</a> method is called  with the <i>enumQueryUpdateAction</i> parameter set to  <b>QUA_REMOVE</b>. </li>
<li>If no PnP notification is received after the device is deleted, and there are no pending PnP events, then the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/functiondiscoveryapi/nf-functiondiscoveryapi-ifunctiondiscoverynotification-onerror">IFunctionDiscoveryNotification::OnError</a> method is called. </li>
<li>Finally, if no PnP notification is received after the device is deleted, and there are pending PnP events, then no callback method is called.</li>
</ul>
To mark a device as unavailable for use without deleting the association database entry, call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/pnpxassoc/nf-pnpxassoc-ipnpxdeviceassociation-unassociate">IPNPXDeviceAssociation::Unassociate</a>.
