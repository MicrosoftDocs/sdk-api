# HEAPALIGNMENT structure


## -description


The HEAPALIGNMENT structure contains data specifying the alignment requirements for a given display memory heap. 


## -struct-fields




### -field dwSize

Specifies the size in bytes of this HEAPALIGNMENT structure.


### -field ddsCaps

Specifies a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff550286(v=vs.85)">DDSCAPS</a> structure that indicates what alignment fields are valid. 


### -field dwReserved

Reserved for system use. 


### -field ExecuteBuffer

Specifies a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dmemmgr/ns-dmemmgr-surfacealignment">SURFACEALIGNMENT</a> structure that contains heap alignment requirements for surfaces tagged with DDSCAPS_EXECUTEBUFFER. 


### -field Overlay

Specifies a SURFACEALIGNMENT structure that contains heap alignment requirements for surfaces tagged with DDSCAPS_OVERLAY. 


### -field Texture

Specifies a SURFACEALIGNMENT structure that contains heap alignment requirements for surfaces tagged with DDSCAPS_TEXTURE. 


### -field ZBuffer

Specifies a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dmemmgr/ns-dmemmgr-surfacealignment">SURFACEALIGNMENT</a> structure that contains heap alignment requirements for surfaces tagged with DDSCAPS_ZBUFFER. 


### -field AlphaBuffer

Specifies a SURFACEALIGNMENT structure that contains heap alignment requirements for surfaces tagged with DDSCAPS_ALPHA. 


### -field Offscreen

Specifies a SURFACEALIGNMENT structure that contains heap alignment requirements for surfaces tagged with DDSCAPS_OFFSCREENPLAIN. 


### -field FlipTarget

Specifies a SURFACEALIGNMENT structure that contains heap alignment requirements for surfaces tagged with DDSCAPS_FLIP. 


## -remarks



The driver should verify that the <b>dwSize</b> member is at least as large as <b>sizeof</b>(HEAPALIGNMENT).
