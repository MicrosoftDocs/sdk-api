## -remarks

For the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winhttp/nf-winhttp-winhttpcrackurl">WinHttpCrackUrl</a> function, if a pointer member and its corresponding length member are both zero, that component of the URL is not returned. If the pointer member is <b>NULL</b> but the length member is not zero, both the pointer and length members are returned. If both pointer and corresponding length members are nonzero, the pointer member points to a buffer where the component is copied. All escape sequences can be removed from a component, depending on the 
<i>dwFlags</i> parameter of 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winhttp/nf-winhttp-winhttpcrackurl">WinHttpCrackUrl</a>.

For the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winhttp/nf-winhttp-winhttpcreateurl">WinHttpCreateUrl</a> function, the pointer members should be <b>NULL</b> if the component of the URL is not required. If the corresponding length member is zero, the pointer member is the pointer to a zero-terminated string. If the length member is not zero, it is the string length of the corresponding pointer member.
