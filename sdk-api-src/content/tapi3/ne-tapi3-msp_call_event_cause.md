# MSP_CALL_EVENT_CAUSE enumeration


## -description

The <b>MSP_CALL_EVENT_CAUSE</b> constant is returned within the 
<a href="/windows/win32/api/msp/ns-msp-msp_event_info">MSP_EVENT_INFO</a> struct by the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/msp/nf-msp-itmspaddress-getevent">GetEvent</a> method when 
<a href="/windows/win32/api/msp/ne-msp-msp_event">MSP_EVENT</a> is ME_CALL_EVENT.

## -enum-fields

### -field CALL_CAUSE_UNKNOWN:0

Call event cause is unknown.

### -field CALL_CAUSE_BAD_DEVICE

A bad device caused failure, for either STREAM_FAIL or TERMINAL_FAIL.

### -field CALL_CAUSE_CONNECT_FAIL

Either connecting the stream failed or connecting the terminal failed. Note that if a terminal cannot be connected to a stream, the application will get a TERMINAL_FAIL event with CMC_CONNECT_FAIL. If this stream failed because the terminal is the only one to use, the application will also get a STREAM_FAIL event with CMC_CONNECT_FAIL.

### -field CALL_CAUSE_LOCAL_REQUEST

The event is the result of the application calling a method on the stream.

### -field CALL_CAUSE_REMOTE_REQUEST

The event is the result of the remote endpoint's request.

### -field CALL_CAUSE_MEDIA_TIMEOUT

The media that carries the stream is temporarily not available.

### -field CALL_CAUSE_MEDIA_RECOVERED

The media that carries the stream is back to normal from a temporary denial of service.

### -field CALL_CAUSE_QUALITY_OF_SERVICE
