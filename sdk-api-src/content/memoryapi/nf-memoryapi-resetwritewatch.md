# ResetWriteWatch function


## -description

Resets the 
    write-tracking state for a region of virtual memory. Subsequent calls to the 
    <a href="/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-getwritewatch">GetWriteWatch</a> function only report pages that are written to since the reset operation.

<b>64-bit Windows on Itanium-based systems:  </b>Due to the difference in page sizes, <b>ResetWriteWatch</b> 
     is not supported for 32-bit applications.

## -parameters

### -param lpBaseAddress [in]

A pointer to the base address of the memory region for which to reset the write-tracking state. 

This address 
      must be in a memory region that is allocated by the 
      <a href="/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc">VirtualAlloc</a> function with <b>MEM_WRITE_WATCH</b>.

### -param dwRegionSize [in]

The size of the memory region for which to reset the write-tracking information, in bytes.

## -returns

If the function succeeds, the return value is 0 (zero).

If the function fails, the return value is a nonzero value.

## -remarks

The <b>ResetWriteWatch</b> function can be useful to an 
    application such as a garbage collector. The application calls the 
    <a href="/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-getwritewatch">GetWriteWatch</a> function to retrieve the list of written 
    pages, and then writes to those pages as part of its cleanup operation. Then the garbage collector calls 
    <b>ResetWriteWatch</b> to remove the write-tracking records 
    caused by the cleanup.

You can also reset the write-tracking state of a memory region by specifying <b>WRITE_WATCH_FLAG_RESET</b> when you 
    call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-getwritewatch">GetWriteWatch</a>.

If you use <b>ResetWriteWatch</b>, you must ensure that 
    no threads write to the region during the interval between the 
    <a href="/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-getwritewatch">GetWriteWatch</a> and 
    <b>ResetWriteWatch</b> calls. Otherwise, there may be written 
    pages that you not detect.
