# CreateFileMappingNumaW function


## -description

Creates or opens a named or unnamed file mapping object for a specified file  and specifies the NUMA 
    node for the physical memory.

## -parameters

### -param hFile [in]

A handle to the file from which to create a file mapping object. 

The file must be opened with access 
       rights that are compatible with the protection flags that the <i>flProtect</i> parameter 
       specifies. It is not required, but it is recommended that files you intend to map be opened for exclusive 
       access. For more information, see 
       <a href="/windows/desktop/FileIO/file-security-and-access-rights">File Security and Access Rights</a>.

If <i>hFile</i> is <b>INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE</b>, the calling process 
       must also specify a size for the file mapping object in the <i>dwMaximumSizeHigh</i> and 
       <i>dwMaximumSizeLow</i> parameters. In this scenario, 
       <b>CreateFileMappingNuma</b> creates a file mapping 
       object of a specified size  that is backed by the system paging file instead of by a file in the file 
       system.

### -param lpFileMappingAttributes [in, optional]

A pointer to a <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/aa379560(v=vs.85)">SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES</a> 
       structure that determines whether a returned handle can be inherited by child processes. The 
       <b>lpSecurityDescriptor</b> member of the  
       <b>SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES</b> structure specifies a 
       security descriptor for a new file mapping object.

If <i>lpFileMappingAttributes</i> is <b>NULL</b>, the handle cannot be 
       inherited and the file mapping object gets a default security descriptor. The access control lists (ACL) in the 
       default security descriptor for a file mapping object come from the primary or impersonation token of the 
       creator. For more information, see 
       <a href="/windows/desktop/Memory/file-mapping-security-and-access-rights">File Mapping Security and Access Rights</a>.

### -param flProtect [in]

Specifies the page protection of the file mapping object. All mapped views of the object must be compatible 
       with this protection. 

This parameter can be one of the following values.

### -param dwMaximumSizeHigh [in]

The high-order <b>DWORD</b> of the maximum size of the file mapping object.

### -param dwMaximumSizeLow [in]

The low-order <b>DWORD</b> of the maximum size of the file mapping object.

If this parameter and the <i>dwMaximumSizeHigh</i> parameter are 0 (zero), the maximum 
        size of the file mapping object is equal to the current size of the file that the 
        <i>hFile</i> parameter identifies.

An attempt to map a file with a length of 0 (zero) fails with an error code of 
        <b>ERROR_FILE_INVALID</b>. Applications should test for files with a length of 0 (zero) and 
        reject those files.

### -param lpName [in, optional]

The name of the file mapping object.

If this parameter matches the name of an existing file mapping object, the function requests access to the 
        object with the protection that the <i>flProtect</i> parameter specifies.

If this parameter is <b>NULL</b>, the file mapping object is created without a name.

If the <i>lpName</i> parameter matches the name of an existing event, semaphore, mutex, 
        waitable timer, or job object, the function fails and the 
        <a href="/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a> function returns 
        <b>ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE</b>. This occurs because these objects share the same namespace.

The name can have a "Global\" or "Local\" prefix to explicitly create the 
        object in the global or session namespace. The remainder of the name can contain any character except the 
        backslash character (\\). Creating a file mapping object in the global namespace requires the 
        <a href="/windows/desktop/SecAuthZ/authorization-constants">SeCreateGlobalPrivilege</a> 
        privilege. For more information, see 
        <a href="/windows/desktop/TermServ/kernel-object-namespaces">Kernel Object Namespaces</a>.

Fast user switching is implemented by using Terminal Services sessions. The first user to log on uses 
        session 0 (zero), the next user to log on uses session 1 (one), and so on. Kernel object names must follow the 
        guidelines so that applications can support multiple users.

### -param nndPreferred [in]

The NUMA node where the physical memory should reside.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="NUMA_NO_PREFERRED_NODE"></a><a id="numa_no_preferred_node"></a><dl>

</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
No NUMA node is preferred. This is the same as calling the 
       <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-createfilemappinga">CreateFileMapping</a> function.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## -returns

If the function succeeds, the return value is a handle to the file mapping object.

If the object exists 
       before the function call, the function returns a handle to the existing object (with its current size, not the 
       specified size) and the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a> function returns <b>ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS</b>.

If the function fails, the return value is <b>NULL</b>. To get extended error information, 
       call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a> function.

## -remarks

After a file mapping object is created, the size of the file must not exceed the size of the file mapping 
    object; if it does, not all of the file contents are available for sharing.

The file mapping object can be shared by duplication, inheritance, or by name. The initial contents of the 
    pages in a file mapping object backed by the page file are 0 (zero).

If an application specifies a size for the file mapping object that is larger than the size of the actual 
     named file on disk and if the page protection allows write access (that is, the 
     <i>flProtect</i> parameter specifies  <b>PAGE_READWRITE</b> or 
     <b>PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE</b>), then the file on disk is increased to match the specified size 
     of the file mapping object. If the file is extended, the contents of the file between the old end of the file and 
     the new end of the file are not guaranteed to be zero; the behavior is defined by the file system.

If the file cannot be increased, the result is a failure to create the file mapping object and the 
     <a href="/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a> function returns 
     <b>ERROR_DISK_FULL</b>.

The handle that the <b>CreateFileMappingNuma</b> 
    function returns has full access to a new file mapping object and can be used with any function that requires a 
    handle to a file mapping object. A file mapping object can be shared through process creation, handle duplication, 
    or by name. For more information, see the 
    <a href="/windows/desktop/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-duplicatehandle">DuplicateHandle</a> and 
    <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-openfilemappinga">OpenFileMapping</a> functions.

Creating a file mapping object creates the potential for mapping a view of the file but does not map the view. 
    The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-mapviewoffileexnuma">MapViewOfFileExNuma</a> function maps a view of a 
    file into a process address space.

With one important exception, file views derived from a single file mapping object are coherent or identical 
    at a specific time. If multiple processes have handles of the same file mapping object, they see a coherent view 
    of the data when they map a view of the file.

The exception is related to remote files. Although the 
    <b>CreateFileMappingNuma</b> function works with remote 
    files, it does not keep them coherent. For example, if two computers both map a file as writable and both change 
    the same page, each computer sees only its own writes to the page. When the data gets updated on the disk, the 
    page is not merged.

A mapped file and a file that is accessed by using the input and output (I/O) functions 
    (<a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile">ReadFile</a> and 
    <a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefile">WriteFile</a>) are not necessarily coherent.

To fully close a file mapping object, an application must unmap all mapped views of the file mapping object by 
     calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-unmapviewoffile">UnmapViewOfFile</a> function and then close 
     the file mapping object handle by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle">CloseHandle</a> 
     function.

These functions can be called in any order. The call to the 
     <a href="/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-unmapviewoffile">UnmapViewOfFile</a> function is necessary, because mapped 
     views of a file mapping object maintain internal open handles to the object, and a file mapping object does not 
     close until all open handles to it are closed.

When modifying a file through a mapped view, the last modification timestamp may not be updated automatically. 
     If required, the caller should use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-setfiletime">SetFileTime</a> to set the 
     timestamp.

Creating a file-mapping object from a session other than session zero requires the 
     <a href="/windows/desktop/SecAuthZ/authorization-constants">SeCreateGlobalPrivilege</a> privilege. 
     Note that this privilege check is limited to the creation of file mapping objects and does not apply to opening 
     existing ones. For example, if a service or the system creates a file mapping object, any process running in any 
     session can access that file mapping object provided that the caller has the required access rights.

Use structured exception handling to protect any code that writes to or reads from a memory mapped view. For 
     more information, see 
     <a href="/windows/desktop/Memory/reading-and-writing-from-a-file-view">Reading and Writing From a File View</a>.

To have a mapping with executable permissions, an application must call the 
     <b>CreateFileMappingNuma</b> function with either 
     <b>PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE</b> or <b>PAGE_EXECUTE_READ</b> and then call the 
     <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-mapviewoffileexnuma">MapViewOfFileExNuma</a> function with 
     <code>FILE_MAP_EXECUTE | FILE_MAP_WRITE</code> or 
     <code>FILE_MAP_EXECUTE | FILE_MAP_READ</code>.
