# VirtualAlloc function

## -description

Reserves, commits, or changes the state  of a region of pages in the virtual address space of the calling process. Memory allocated by this function is automatically initialized to zero.

To allocate memory in the address space of another process, use the [VirtualAllocEx](/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualallocex) function.

## -parameters

### -param lpAddress [in, optional]

The starting address of the region to allocate. If the memory is being reserved, the specified address is rounded down to the nearest multiple of the allocation granularity. If the memory is already reserved and is being committed, the address is rounded down to the next page boundary. To determine the size of a page and the allocation granularity on the host computer, use the [GetSystemInfo](/windows/win32/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getsysteminfo) function. If this parameter is **NULL**, the system determines where to allocate the region.

If this address is within an enclave that you have not initialized by calling [InitializeEnclave](/windows/win32/api/enclaveapi/nf-enclaveapi-initializeenclave), **VirtualAlloc** allocates a page of zeros for the enclave at that address. The page must be previously uncommitted, and will not be measured with the EEXTEND instruction of the Intel Software Guard Extensions programming model.

If the address is within an enclave that you initialized, then the allocation operation fails with the **ERROR_INVALID_ADDRESS** error. That is true for enclaves that do not support dynamic memory management (i.e. SGX1). SGX2 enclaves will permit allocation, and the page must be accepted by the enclave after it has been allocated.

### -param dwSize [in]

The size of the region, in bytes. If the _lpAddress_ parameter is **NULL**, this value is rounded up to the next page boundary. Otherwise, the allocated pages include all pages containing one or more bytes in the range from _lpAddress_ to _lpAddress_+_dwSize_. This means that a 2-byte range straddling a page boundary causes both pages to be included in the allocated region.

### -param flAllocationType [in]

The type of memory allocation. This parameter must contain one of the following values.

<td width="60%">
Allocates memory charges (from the overall size of memory and the paging files on disk) for the specified reserved memory pages. The function also guarantees that when the caller later initially accesses the memory, the contents will be zero.  Actual physical pages are not allocated unless/until the virtual addresses are actually accessed.

To reserve and commit pages in one step, call <b>VirtualAlloc</b> with <code>MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE</code>.

Attempting to commit a specific address range by specifying <b>MEM_COMMIT</b> without <b>MEM_RESERVE</b> and a non-<b>NULL</b> <i>lpAddress</i> fails unless the entire range has already been reserved. The  resulting error code is <b>ERROR_INVALID_ADDRESS</b>.

An attempt to commit a page that is already committed does not cause the function to fail. This means that you can commit pages without first determining the current commitment state of each page.

If <i>lpAddress</i> specifies an address within an enclave, <i>flAllocationType</i> must be <b>MEM_COMMIT</b>.

Reserves a range of the process's virtual address space without allocating any actual physical storage in memory or in the paging file on disk.

You can commit reserved pages in subsequent calls to the <b>VirtualAlloc</b> function. To reserve and commit pages in one step, call <b>VirtualAlloc</b> with <b>MEM_COMMIT</b> | <b>MEM_RESERVE</b>.

Other memory allocation functions, such as <b>malloc</b> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-localalloc">LocalAlloc</a>, cannot use a reserved range of memory until it is released.

<td width="60%">
Indicates that data in the memory range specified by <i>lpAddress</i> and <i>dwSize</i> is no longer of interest. The pages should not be read from or written to the paging file. However, the memory block will be used again later, so it should not be decommitted. This value cannot be used with any other value.

Using this value does not guarantee that the range operated on with <b>MEM_RESET</b> will contain zeros. If you want the range to contain zeros, decommit the memory and then recommit it.

When you specify <b>MEM_RESET</b>, the <b>VirtualAlloc</b> function ignores the value of <i>flProtect</i>. However, you must still set <i>flProtect</i> to a valid protection value, such as <b>PAGE_NOACCESS</b>.

<b>VirtualAlloc</b> returns an error if you use <b>MEM_RESET</b> and the range of memory is mapped to a file. A shared view is only acceptable if it is mapped to a paging file.

<b>MEM_RESET_UNDO</b> should only be called on an address range to which <b>MEM_RESET</b> was successfully applied earlier. It indicates that the data in the specified memory range specified by <i>lpAddress</i> and <i>dwSize</i> is of interest to the caller and attempts to reverse the effects of <b>MEM_RESET</b>. If the function succeeds, that means all data in the specified address range is intact. If the function fails, at least some of the data in the address range has been replaced with zeroes.

This value cannot be used with any other value. If <b>MEM_RESET_UNDO</b> is called on an address range which was not <b>MEM_RESET</b> earlier, the behavior is undefined. When you specify <b>MEM_RESET</b>, the <b>VirtualAlloc</b> function ignores the value of <i>flProtect</i>. However, you must still set <i>flProtect</i> to a valid protection value, such as <b>PAGE_NOACCESS</b>.

<b>Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP:  </b>The <b>MEM_RESET_UNDO</b> flag is not supported until Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.

### -param flProtect [in]

The memory protection for the region of pages to be allocated. If the pages are being committed, you can specify any one of the [memory protection constants](/windows/win32/Memory/memory-protection-constants).

If _lpAddress_ specifies an address within an enclave, _flProtect_ cannot be any of the following values:

- PAGE_NOACCESS
- PAGE_GUARD
- PAGE_NOCACHE
- PAGE_WRITECOMBINE

When allocating dynamic memory for an enclave, the _flProtect_ parameter must be **PAGE_READWRITE** or **PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE**.

## -returns

If the function succeeds, the return value is the base address of the allocated region of pages.

If the function fails, the return value is **NULL**. To get extended error information, call [GetLastError](/windows/win32/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror).

## -remarks

Each page has an associated [page state](/windows/win32/Memory/page-state). The **VirtualAlloc** function can perform the following operations:

- Commit a region of reserved pages
- Reserve a region of free pages
- Simultaneously reserve and commit a region of free pages

**VirtualAlloc** cannot reserve a reserved page. It can commit a page that is already committed. This means you can commit a range of pages, regardless of whether they have already been committed, and the function will not fail.

You can use **VirtualAlloc** to reserve a block of pages and then make additional calls to **VirtualAlloc** to commit individual pages from the reserved block. This enables a process to reserve a range of its virtual address space without consuming physical storage until it is needed.

If the _lpAddress_ parameter is not **NULL**, the function uses the _lpAddress_ and _dwSize_ parameters to compute the region of pages to be allocated. The current state of the entire range of pages must be compatible with the type of allocation specified by the _flAllocationType_ parameter. Otherwise, the function fails and none of the pages are allocated. This compatibility requirement does not preclude committing an already committed page, as mentioned previously.

To execute dynamically generated code, use **VirtualAlloc** to allocate memory and the [VirtualProtect](/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualprotect) function to grant **PAGE_EXECUTE** access.

The **VirtualAlloc** function can be used to reserve an [Address Windowing Extensions](/windows/win32/Memory/address-windowing-extensions) (AWE) region of memory within the virtual address space of a specified process. This region of memory can then be used to map physical pages into and out of virtual memory as required by the application. The **MEM_PHYSICAL** and **MEM_RESERVE** values must be set in the _AllocationType_ parameter. The **MEM_COMMIT** value must not be set. The page protection must be set to **PAGE_READWRITE**.

The [VirtualFree](/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualfree) function can decommit a committed page, releasing the page's storage, or it can simultaneously decommit and release a committed page. It can also release a reserved page, making it a free page.

When creating a region that will be executable, the calling program bears responsibility for ensuring cache coherency via an appropriate call to [FlushInstructionCache](/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-flushinstructioncache) once the code has been set in place. Otherwise attempts to execute code out of the newly executable region may produce unpredictable results.
