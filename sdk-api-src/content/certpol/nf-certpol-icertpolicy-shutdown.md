# ICertPolicy::ShutDown


## -description


The <b>ShutDown</b> method is called by the server engine before the server is terminated.

When <b>ShutDown</b> is called, the policy module should clean up and stop. It is guaranteed that no requests will arrive after <b>ShutDown</b> is called.


## -parameters






## -returns



<h3>VB</h3>
 If the method succeeds, the method returns S_OK.

If the method fails, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value that indicates the error. For a list of common error codes, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/common-hresult-values">Common HRESULT Values</a>.




## -remarks



When you write custom policy modules, implement this method.


#### Examples


```cpp
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <Certpol.h>

STDMETHODIMP CCertPolicy::ShutDown()
{
    // Clean up resources used by this process.

    // Display message that this method has been called.
    if ( fDebug )
    {
        printf("Policy module Shutdown was called\n");
    }
    return( S_OK );
}
```
