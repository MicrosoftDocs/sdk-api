# ICertPolicy::Initialize


## -description


The <b>Initialize</b> method is called by the server engine to allow the policy module to perform initialization tasks.


## -parameters




### -param strConfig [in]

Represents the name of the certification authority, as entered during Certificate Services setup. For information about the configuration string name, see 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/certcli/nn-certcli-icertconfig2">ICertConfig2</a>.


## -returns



<h3>VB</h3>
 If the method succeeds, the method returns S_OK.

If the method fails, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value that indicates the error. For a list of common error codes, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/common-hresult-values">Common HRESULT Values</a>.




## -remarks



When you write custom policy modules, implement this method.


#### Examples


```cpp
#include <windows.h>
#include <Certpol.h>

STDMETHODIMP CCertPolicy::Initialize(
    /* [in] */ BSTR const strConfig)
{
    // strConfig can be used by the Policy module.
    // Here, it is stored in a BSTR member variable.
    // m_strConfig is an application-defined variable.
    // Call SysFreeString to free m_strConfig when done.
    m_strConfig = SysAllocString( strConfig );
    // Check to determine whether there was enough memory.
    if (NULL == m_strConfig)
        return ( E_OUTOFMEMORY );  // Not enough memory

    return( S_OK );
}
```
