## -remarks

 After the interface has been instantiated, the XPS package must be loaded by calling this method or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/xpsdigitalsignature/nf-xpsdigitalsignature-ixpssignaturemanager-loadpackagestream">LoadPackageStream</a> before
calling any other method in this interface.

After an XPS package has been loaded into an instance of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/xpsdigitalsignature/nn-xpsdigitalsignature-ixpssignaturemanager">IXpsSignatureManager</a>, calling <b>LoadPackageFile</b> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/xpsdigitalsignature/nf-xpsdigitalsignature-ixpssignaturemanager-loadpackagestream">LoadPackageStream</a> in the same instance will return an error.

After <b>LoadPackageFile</b> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/xpsdigitalsignature/nf-xpsdigitalsignature-ixpssignaturemanager-loadpackagestream">LoadPackageStream</a> has been called, the same object cannot be reused for another XPS package file or stream. To load another XPS package, a new instance of   <a href="/windows/desktop/api/xpsdigitalsignature/nn-xpsdigitalsignature-ixpssignaturemanager">IXpsSignatureManager</a> must be instantiated.


<a href="/windows/desktop/api/xpsdigitalsignature/nf-xpsdigitalsignature-ixpssignaturemanager-loadpackagestream">LoadPackageStream</a> does not validate all content of the XPS package; it does not, for example, detect invalid markup in a FixedPage part.
