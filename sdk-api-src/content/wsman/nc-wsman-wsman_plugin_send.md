# WSMAN_PLUGIN_SEND callback function


## -description

Defines the send callback for a plug-in. This function is called for each object that is received from a client.  Each object received causes the callback to be called once.
After the data is processed, the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) plug-in calls <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wsman/nf-wsman-wsmanpluginoperationcomplete">WSManPluginOperationComplete</a> to acknowledge receipt and to allow the next object to be delivered.

The DLL entry point name must be <b>WSManPluginSend</b>.

## -parameters

### -param shellContext
