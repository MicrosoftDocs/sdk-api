# WSManCloseOperation function


## -description


Cancels or closes an asynchronous operation. All resources that are associated with the operation are freed.


## -parameters




### -param operationHandle [in, out, optional]

Specifies the operation handle to be closed.


### -param flags

Reserved for future use. Set to zero.


## -returns



This method returns zero on success. Otherwise, this method returns an error code.




## -remarks



The method de-allocates local and remote resources associated with the operation. After the <b>WSManCloseOperation</b> method is called, the <i>operationHandle</i> parameter cannot be passed to any other call. If the callback associated with the operation is pending and has not completed before <b>WSManCloseOperation</b> is called, the operation is marked for deletion and the method returns immediately.
