# WSMAN_PLUGIN_SIGNAL callback function


## -description

Defines the signal callback for a plug-in. This function is called when an inbound signal is 
     received from a client call.

The DLL entry point name for this method must be 
    <b>WSManPluginSignal</b>.

## -parameters

### -param *requestDetails [in]

A pointer to a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wsman/ns-wsman-wsman_plugin_request">WSMAN_PLUGIN_REQUEST</a> 
      structure that specifies the resource URI, options, locale, shutdown flag, and handle for the request.

### -param flags [in]

Reserved for future use. Must be zero.

### -param shellContext [in]

Specifies the context that was received when the shell was created.

### -param commandContext [in, optional]

If this request is aimed at a command and not a shell, this is the context returned from the 
      <b>winrm create</b> operation;  otherwise, this parameter is <b>NULL</b>.

### -param code [in]

Specifies the signal that is received from the client. The following codes are common.



#### WSMAN_SIGNAL_SHELL_CODE_TERMINATE

The shell or Command Prompt window was closed. The plug-in should call the 
        <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wsman/nf-wsman-wsmanpluginoperationcomplete">WSManPluginOperationComplete</a> 
        function.



#### WSMAN_SIGNAL_SHELL_CODE_CTRL_C

The signal for CTRL+C was received, and the process was halted. The plug-in should call the 
        <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wsman/nf-wsman-wsmanpluginoperationcomplete">WSManPluginOperationComplete</a> 
        function.



#### WSMAN_SIGNAL_SHELL_CODE_CTRL_BREAK

The signal for CTRL+BREAK was received, and the process was halted. The plug-in should call the 
        <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wsman/nf-wsman-wsmanpluginoperationcomplete">WSManPluginOperationComplete</a> 
        function.

## -remarks

A signal can be received for processing a CTRL+C sequence or one of many other types of custom signals. The 
    callback is called once for each signal that is received. The plug-in determines which signals cause commands 
    and/or shells to be shut down. Because signals are shell-specific, the plug-in must initiate the shutdown by 
    calling the 
    <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wsman/nf-wsman-wsmanpluginoperationcomplete">WSManPluginOperationComplete</a> method. For 
    each call, the plug-in should call 
    <b>WSManPluginOperationComplete</b> to 
    acknowledge receipt and to allow the next signal to be received.
