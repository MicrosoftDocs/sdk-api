# WSMAN_PLUGIN_AUTHORIZE_QUERY_QUOTA callback function


## -description


Retrieves quota information for the user after a connection has been authorized. This method will be called only if the configuration specifies that quotas are enabled within the authorization plug-in.

The DLL entry point name for this method must be <b>WSManPluginAuthzQueryQuota</b>.


## -parameters




### -param pluginContext [in]

Specifies the context that was returned by a call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wsman/nc-wsman-wsman_plugin_startup">WSManPluginStartup</a>. This parameter represents a specific application initialization of a WinRM plug-in.


### -param *senderDetails [in]

A pointer  to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wsman/ns-wsman-wsman_sender_details">WSMAN_SENDER_DETAILS</a> structure that specifies the identification information of the user.


### -param flags [in]

Reserved for future use. Must be zero.


## -remarks



The quota is queried on the first call by a particular user and will not be requeried until after the user record times out due to an idle time-out of activity or until a system-wide configuration period is exceeded.

The plug-in must call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wsman/nf-wsman-wsmanpluginauthzqueryquotacomplete">WSManPluginAuthzQueryQuotaComplete</a> function to terminate the operation whether or not the plug-in can carry out the request. If successful, the plug-in should give a set of quota information that is relevant for this particular user. If the plug-in fails to process the request for any reason,  an appropriate error should be recorded through the callback method and the error will get propagated back to the client as a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) fault if possible; otherwise, the error will be an empty HTTP 500 status error.
