# WSMAN_PLUGIN_STARTUP callback function


## -description


Defines the startup callback for the plug-in. Because multiple applications can be hosted in the same process, this method can be called multiple times, but only once for each application initialization. A plug-in can be initialized more than once within the same process but only once for each <i>applicationIdentification</i> value. The context that is returned from this method should be application specific. The returned context will be passed into all future plug-in calls that are specific to the application. All Windows Remote Management (WinRM) plug-ins must implement this callback function.

The DLL entry point name for this method must be <b>WSManPluginStartup</b>.


## -parameters




### -param flags

Reserved for future use. Must be zero.


### -param applicationIdentification

A unique identifier for the hosted application. For the main WinRM service, the default is <b>wsman</b>. For an Internet Information Services (IIS) host, this identifier is related to the application endpoint for that host. For example, <b>wsman/MyCompany/MyApplication</b>.


### -param extraInfo

A string that contains configuration information, if any information was stored when the plug-in was registered. When the plug-in is registered using the WinRM configuration, the plug-in can add extra configuration parameters that are useful during initialization to an optional node.  This information can be especially useful if a plug-in is used in different IIS hosting scenarios and requires slightly different run-time semantics during initialization.  This string is a copy of the XML from the configuration, if one is present.  Otherwise, this parameter is set to <b>NULL</b>.


### -param *pluginContext

The context for the specific application initialization.  This context is passed through to all other WinRM plug-in calls that are associated with this <i>applicationIdentifier</i>.


## -returns



The method returns <b>NO_ERROR</b> if it succeeded; otherwise,  it returns an error code.  If this method returns an error, the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wsman/nc-wsman-wsman_plugin_shutdown">WSManPluginShutdown</a> entry point will not be called.
