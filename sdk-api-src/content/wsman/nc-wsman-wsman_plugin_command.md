# WSMAN_PLUGIN_COMMAND callback function


## -description


Defines the command callback for a plug-in. This function is called when a request for a command is received. All Windows Remote Management plug-ins that support shell operations and need to create commands must implement this callback.

The DLL entry point name must be <b>WSManPluginCommand</b>.


## -parameters




### -param *requestDetails

A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wsman/ns-wsman-wsman_plugin_request">WSMAN_PLUGIN_REQUEST</a> structure that specifies the resource URI, options, locale, shutdown flag, and handle for the request.


### -param flags

Reserved for future use. Must be set to zero.


### -param shellContext

Specifies the context returned from creating the shell for which this command needs to be associated.


### -param commandLine

Specifies the command line to be run.


### -param *arguments

A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wsman/ns-wsman-wsman_command_arg_set">WSMAN_COMMAND_ARG_SET</a> structure that specifies  the command-line arguments to be passed to the command.


## -remarks



The WinRM (WinRM) plug-in will call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wsman/nf-wsman-wsmanpluginreportcontext">WSManPluginReportContext</a> method to register a command context for the command. All operations on this command are passed into this context. The context must be valid until the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wsman/nf-wsman-wsmanpluginoperationcomplete">WSManPluginOperationComplete</a> method is called by the plug-in to indicate that either the command is complete or the shell was shut down. All parameters passed in are valid until the WinRM plug-in calls <b>WSManPluginOperationComplete</b>.
