# IDirect3DDeviceManager9 interface


## -description

Enables two threads to share the same Direct3D 9 device, and provides access to the DirectX Video Acceleration (DXVA) features of the device.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IDirect3DDeviceManager9</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IDirect3DDeviceManager9</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

This interface is exposed by the <a href="/windows/desktop/medfound/direct3d-device-manager">Direct3D Device Manager</a>. To create the Direct3D device manager, call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/dxva2api/nf-dxva2api-dxva2createdirect3ddevicemanager9">DXVA2CreateDirect3DDeviceManager9</a>.

To get this interface from the <a href="/windows/desktop/medfound/enhanced-video-renderer">Enhanced Video Renderer</a> (EVR), call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mfidl/nf-mfidl-imfgetservice-getservice">IMFGetService::GetService</a>. The service GUID is <b>MR_VIDEO_ACCELERATION_SERVICE</b>. For the DirectShow EVR filter, call <b>GetService</b> on the filter's pins.

The Direct3D Device Manager supports Direct3D 9 devices only. It does not support DXGI devices.

Windows Store apps must use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mfobjects/nn-mfobjects-imfdxgidevicemanager">IMFDXGIDeviceManager</a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/medfound/direct3d-11-video-apis">Direct3D 11 Video APIs</a>.
