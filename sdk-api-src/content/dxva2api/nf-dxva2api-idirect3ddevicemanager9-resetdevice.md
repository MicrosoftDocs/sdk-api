# IDirect3DDeviceManager9::ResetDevice


## -description


Sets the Direct3D device or notifies the device manager that the Direct3D device was reset.


## -parameters




### -param pDevice [in]

Pointer to the <b>IDirect3DDevice9</b> interface of the Direct3D device.


### -param resetToken [in]

Token received in the <i>pResetToken</i> parameter of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dxva2api/nf-dxva2api-dxva2createdirect3ddevicemanager9">DXVA2CreateDirect3DDeviceManager9</a> function.


## -returns

## -remarks



When you first create the Direct3D device manager, call this method with a pointer to the Direct3D device. The device manager does not create the device; the caller must provide the device pointer initially.

Also call this method if the Direct3D device becomes lost and you need to reset the device or create a new device. This occurs if <b>IDirect3DDevice9::TestCooperativeLevel</b> returns D3DERR_DEVICELOST or D3DERR_DEVICENOTRESET. For more information about lost devices, see the Direct3D documentation.

The <i>resetToken</i> parameter ensures that only the component which originally created the device manager can invalidate the current device.

If this method succeeds, all open device handles become invalid.
