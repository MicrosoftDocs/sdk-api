## -remarks

 When <b>PeerCollabCancelInvitation</b> is called, depending on the state of the invitation, it will perform one or more of the following actions:


<ul>
<li>If the connection to the receiver is not yet established, it will cancel the connection creation process and the receiver will not see the invitation.</li>
<li>If the invitation has been received, but not responded to, it will notify the recipient contact that the invitation has been canceled. As a result, the receiver will not be able to respond to the invitation.</li>
<li>If the receiver has already responded to the invitation, the call performs a no-op.
After canceling the invitation, you must call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/p2p/nf-p2p-peercollabclosehandle">PeerCollabCloseHandle</a>.
</li>
</ul>
