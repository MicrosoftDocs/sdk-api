# PEER_APPLICATION_REGISTRATION_INFO structure


## -description

The <b>PEER_APPLICATION_REGISTRATION_INFO</b> structure contains peer application information for registration with the local computer.

## -struct-fields

### -field application

<a href="/windows/desktop/api/p2p/ns-p2p-peer_application">PEER_APPLICATION</a> structure that contains the specific peer application data.

### -field pwzApplicationToLaunch

Zero-terminated Unicode string that contains the local path to the executable peer application. Note that this data is for local use only and that this structure is never transmitted remotely.

### -field pwzApplicationArguments

Zero-terminated Unicode string that contains command-line arguments that must be supplied to the application when the application is launched. This data is for local use only. The PEER_APPLICATION_REGISTRATION_INFO  structure is never transmitted remotely.

### -field dwPublicationScope

<a href="/windows/desktop/api/p2p/ne-p2p-peer_publication_scope">PEER_PUBLICATION_SCOPE</a> enumeration value that specifies the publication scope for this application registration information. The only valid value for this member is PEER_PUBLICATION_SCOPE_INTERNET.

## -remarks

An "application" is a set of software or software  components available on the peer's endpoint. Commonly, this refers to software packages that support peer networking activities, like games or other collaborative applications.

A peer application has a GUID representing a single specific application. When an application is registered for a peer, this GUID and the corresponding application can be made available to all trusted contacts of the peer, indicating the activities the peer can participate in. To deregister a peer's application, call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/p2p/nf-p2p-peercollabunregisterapplication">PeerCollabUnregisterApplication</a> with this GUID.
