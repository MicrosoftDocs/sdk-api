# PEER_APPLICATION structure


## -description

## -struct-fields




### -field id

The GUID value under which the application is registered with the local computer.


### -field data


<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/p2p/ns-p2p-peer_data">PEER_DATA</a> structure that contains the application information in a member byte buffer. This information is available to anyone who can query for the local peer's member information. This data is limited to 16K.


### -field pwzDescription

Pointer to a zero-terminated Unicode string that contains an optional  description of the local application. This description is limited to 255 unicode characters.


## -remarks



An "application" is a set of software or software  features available on the peer's endpoint. Commonly, this refers to software packages that support peer networking activities, like games or other collaborative applications.

A peer application has a GUID representing a single specific application. When an application is registered for a peer, this GUID and the corresponding application can be made available to all trusted contacts of the peer, indicating the activities the peer can participate in. To deregister a peer application, call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/p2p/nf-p2p-peercollabunregisterapplication">PeerCollabUnregisterApplication</a> with this GUID.
