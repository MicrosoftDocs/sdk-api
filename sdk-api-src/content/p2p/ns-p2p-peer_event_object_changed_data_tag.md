## -struct-fields




### -field pContact

Pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b84a17fc-35d6-4098-9bb3-18e708541a80">PEER_CONTACT</a> structure that contains the peer contact information for the contact whose peer object data changed.


### -field pEndpoint

Pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9687b332-14ed-4023-b8c2-437d75fd0298">PEER_ENDPOINT</a> structure that contains the peer endpoint information for the contact whose peer object data changed.


### -field changeType


<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ef8f1cc7-e1db-4d6d-9ff6-141746d0787a">PEER_CHANGE_TYPE</a> enumeration value that specifies the type of change that occurred.


### -field pObject

Pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6babceaf-9648-4226-a0ce-6f4ae831e4a7">PEER_OBJECT</a> structure that contains the peer object data whose change raised the event. This most commonly occurs when a new peer object is received by the peer.


## -remarks



Peer objects are run-time data items associated with a particular application, such as a picture or avatar, a certificate, or a specific description. Each peer object must be smaller than 16K in size.

Trusted contacts watching this peer object will have a PEER_EVENT_OBJECT_CHANGED event raised on them signaling the peer object's change in status.

The PEER_EVENT_OBJECT_CHANGED event is raised when an object is changed by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/99a3e206-7d76-4773-956c-bbd101766392">PeerCollabSetObject</a>. If it is the first time the object is set then <b>changeType</b> is set to PEER_CHANGE_ADDED. On subsequent calls of PeerCollabSetObject for the same object ID the <b>changeType</b> is set to PEER_CHANGE_UDPATED.

If <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4849f8da-7f8a-4951-94eb-624ee186ec83">PeerCollabDeleteObject</a> is called the PEER_CHANGE_DELETED event is raised.
