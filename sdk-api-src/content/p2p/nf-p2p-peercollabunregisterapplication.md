## -remarks



An <i>application</i> is a set of software or software  features available on the peer's endpoint. Commonly, this refers to software packages that support peer networking activities, like games or other collaborative applications.

The collaboration infrastructure can receive application invites from trusted contacts or from "People Near Me", which are based on what scope the collaboration infrastructure is signed in with using PeerCollabSignin.

A peer's application has a GUID representing a single specific application. When application is registered for a peer, this GUID and the corresponding application can be made available to all trusted contacts of the peer, indicating the activities the peer can participate in. To unregister a peer's application, call <b>PeerCollabUnregisterApplication</b> with this GUID.

To unregister the application for all users, the caller of this API must be elevated.
