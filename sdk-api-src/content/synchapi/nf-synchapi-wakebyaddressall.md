# WakeByAddressAll function


## -description


Wakes all threads that are waiting for the value of an address to change.


## -parameters




### -param Address [in]

The address to signal. If any threads have previously called 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-waitonaddress">WaitOnAddress</a> for this address, the system wakes all 
      of the waiting threads.


## -remarks



Windows Store apps developers may need to obtain synchronization.lib by installing the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/desktop/hh852363">Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 8</a>.

Only threads within the same process can be woken.
