# VDS_VOLUME_STATUS enumeration


## -description

<p class="CCE_Message">[Beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, the <a href="/windows/desktop/VDS/virtual-disk-service-portal">Virtual Disk Service</a> COM interface is superseded by the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/windows-storage-management-api-portal">Windows Storage Management API</a>.]

Defines the set of object status values for a volume.

## -enum-fields

### -field VDS_VS_UNKNOWN:0

The status of the volume is unknown. This value does not apply to dynamic volumes.

### -field VDS_VS_ONLINE:1

The volume is available.

### -field VDS_VS_NO_MEDIA:3

The volume is removable media, such as a CD-ROM.

### -field VDS_VS_FAILED:5

The volume is unavailable.

### -field VDS_VS_OFFLINE:4

The volume is offline.

<b>Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2003:  </b>Not supported. If the volume is offline, the <b>VDS_VF_PERMANENTLY_DISMOUNTED</b> flag is set in the <b>ulFlags</b> member of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vds/ns-vds-vds_volume_prop">VDS_VOLUME_PROP</a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vds/ns-vds-vds_volume_prop2">VDS_VOLUME_PROP2</a> structure.

## -remarks

When the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vds/nf-vds-ivdspack-getproperties">IVdsPack::GetProperties</a> method returns a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vds/ns-vds-vds_pack_prop">VDS_PACK_PROP</a> structure whose <b>status</b> member is VDS_PS_OFFLINE, VDS sets the status for all the  volumes in the pack to VDS_VS_FAILED. VDS sets the status for specific volume types to VDS_VS_FAILED under the following conditions:

<ul>
<li>For simple, spanned, and striped volumes—whenever a disk is missing.</li>
<li>For mirrored volumes—when any disk, except the last disk, is missing or has write errors that  the plex transitions to a detached condition. Likewise, if it is the last (non-stale) plex and the disk is missing.</li>
<li>For stripe with parity (RAID-5)—when the second disk is missing, or if one column becomes detached (because the disk is missing or the column has write errors), and a second disk is missing.</li>
</ul>
The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vds/ns-vds-vds_volume_prop">VDS_VOLUME_PROP</a> structure includes a <b>VDS_VOLUME_STATUS</b> value as a member to indicate the status of a volume.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Additional constants might be added to the <b>VDS_VOLUME_STATUS</b> enumeration in future Windows versions. For this reason, your application must be designed to gracefully handle an unrecognized <b>VDS_VOLUME_STATUS</b> enumeration constant.</div>
<div> </div>
