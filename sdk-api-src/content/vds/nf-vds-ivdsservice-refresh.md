## -returns



This method can return standard HRESULT values, such as E_OUTOFMEMORY, and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VDS/virtual-disk-service-common-return-codes">VDS-specific return values</a>. It can also return converted <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Debug/system-error-codes">system error codes</a>  using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winerror/nf-winerror-hresult_from_win32">HRESULT_FROM_WIN32</a> macro. Errors can originate from VDS itself or from the underlying <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VDS/about-vds">VDS provider</a> that is being used. Possible return values include the following.

## -remarks



This method synchronizes the disk layout to the layout known to the disk driver. It does not force the driver to read the layout from the disk. Additionally, this method refreshes the view of all objects in the VDS cache. VDS and the providers query all objects, sending object arrival, modification, removal notifications to synchronize the caller. Note that VDS updates the cache automatically whenever it detects a change that triggers a notification. For this reason, and because calling <b>Refresh</b> can trigger additional notifications, applications should not call this method in response to notifications. <b>Refresh</b> should be called only when it appears that the cache is not being updated properly.
