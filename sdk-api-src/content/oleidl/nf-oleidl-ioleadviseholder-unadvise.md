## -remarks



<b>IOleAdviseHolder::Unadvise</b> is intended to be used to implement <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/oleidl/nf-oleidl-ioleobject-unadvise">IOleObject::Unadvise</a> to delete an advisory connection. In general, you would use the OLE advise holder having obtained a pointer through a call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ole2/nf-ole2-createoleadviseholder">CreateOleAdviseHolder</a>.

Typically, containers call this method at shutdown or when an object is deleted. In certain cases, containers could call this method on objects that are running but not currently visible, as a way of reducing the overhead of maintaining multiple advisory connections.
