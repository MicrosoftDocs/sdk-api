# IOleAdviseHolder::SendOnClose


## -description

Sends notification to all advisory sinks currently registered with the advise holder that the object has closed.

## -parameters

## -returns

This method returns S_OK if advise sinks were notified of the close operation through a call to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-iadvisesink-onclose">IAdviseSink::OnClose</a> method.

## -remarks

<b>SendOnClose</b> must call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-iadvisesink-onclose">IAdviseSink::OnClose</a> on all advise sinks that have a valid advisory connection with the object, whenever the object goes from the running state to the loaded state. This occurs through a call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/oleidl/nf-oleidl-ioleobject-close">IOleObject::Close</a>, so you can call <b>SendOnClose</b> when you determine that a Close operation has been successful.
