# IOleAdviseHolder::SendOnRename


## -description


Sends notification to all advisory sinks currently registered with the advise holder that the name of object has changed.


## -parameters




### -param pmk [in]

A pointer to the new full moniker of the object.


## -returns



This method returns S_OK if advise sinks were sent <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-iadvisesink-onrename">IAdviseSink::OnRename</a> notifications.




## -remarks



<b>SendOnRename</b> calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-iadvisesink-onrename">IAdviseSink::OnRename</a> to advise the calling object, which must have already established an advisory connection, that the object has a new moniker. If you are using the OLE advise holder (having obtained a pointer through a call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ole2/nf-ole2-createoleadviseholder">CreateOleAdviseHolder</a>), you can call <b>SendOnRename</b> in the implementation of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/oleidl/nf-oleidl-ioleobject-setmoniker">IOleObject::SetMoniker</a>, when you have determined that the operation is successful.
