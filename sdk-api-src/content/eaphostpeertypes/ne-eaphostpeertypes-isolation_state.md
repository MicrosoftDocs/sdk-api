# ISOLATION_STATE enumeration


## -description


Defines the set of possible isolation state values of a machine.  The isolation state of a machine determines its network connectivity.


## -enum-fields




### -field ISOLATION_STATE_UNKNOWN

The client's access to the network is unknown.


### -field ISOLATION_STATE_NOT_RESTRICTED

The client has unrestricted full access to the network.


### -field ISOLATION_STATE_IN_PROBATION

The client has probationary access to the network for a limited amount of time during which time they must fix their system.


### -field ISOLATION_STATE_RESTRICTED_ACCESS

The client has restricted access to the network; the client is allowed access to some servers only from which they can obtain necessary information and patches to update themselves to become healthy. 


### -field v1_enum




## -remarks



Network Access Protection (NAP) uses the <b>ISOLATION_STATE</b> value to determine if a client should be granted  network access.
