# StringAlignment enumeration


## -description

The <b>StringAlignment</b> enumeration specifies how a string is aligned in reference to the bounding rectangle. A bounding rectangle is used to define the area in which the text displays.

## -enum-fields

### -field StringAlignmentNear

Specifies that alignment is towards the origin of the bounding rectangle. May be used for alignment of characters along the line or for alignment of lines within the rectangle. For a right to left bounding rectangle (<a href="/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusenums/ne-gdiplusenums-stringformatflags">StringFormatFlagsDirectionRightToLeft</a>), the origin is at the upper right.

### -field StringAlignmentCenter

Specifies that alignment is centered between origin and extent (width) of the formatting rectangle.

### -field StringAlignmentFar

Specifies that alignment is to the far extent (right side) of the formatting rectangle.
