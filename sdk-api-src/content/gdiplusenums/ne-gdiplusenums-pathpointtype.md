## -description

The <b>PathPointType</b> enumeration indicates point types and flags for the data points in a path. Bits 0 through 2 indicate the type of a point, and bits 3 through 7 hold a set of flags that specify attributes of a point. This enumeration is used by the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/gdipluspath/nl-gdipluspath-graphicspath">GraphicsPath</a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/gdipluspath/nl-gdipluspath-graphicspathiterator">GraphicsPathIterator</a>, and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/gdiplustypes/nl-gdiplustypes-pathdata">PathData</a> classes.

## -enum-fields

### -field PathPointTypeStart

Indicates that the point is the start of a figure.

### -field PathPointTypeLine

Indicates that the point is one of the two endpoints of a line.

### -field PathPointTypeBezier

Indicates that the point is an endpoint or control point of a cubic Bézier spline.

### -field PathPointTypePathTypeMask

Masks all bits except for the three low-order bits, which indicate the point type.

### -field PathPointTypeDashMode

Not used.

### -field PathPointTypePathMarker

Specifies that the point is a marker.

### -field PathPointTypeCloseSubpath

Specifies that the point is the last point in a closed subpath (figure).

### -field PathPointTypeBezier3

Indicates that the point is an endpoint or control point of a cubic Bézier spline. 

## -remarks

A <a href="/windows/desktop/api/gdipluspath/nl-gdipluspath-graphicspath">GraphicsPath</a> object has an array of points and an array of types. Each element in the array of types is a byte that specifies the point type and a set of flags for the corresponding element in the array of points.
