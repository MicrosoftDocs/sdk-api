# EnclaveVerifyAttestationReport function


## -description

Verifies an attestation report that was generated on the current system.

## -parameters

### -param EnclaveType [in]

The type of the enclave for which the report was generated. Must be <b>ENCLAVE_TYPE_VBS</b>.

### -param Report [in]

A pointer to a buffer that stores the report.  This report may be stored either within the address range of the enclave or within the address space of the host process.

### -param ReportSize [in]

 The size of the report, in bytes.

## -returns

If this function succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

## -remarks

This function is used if two enclaves run on the same system and need to establish a secure channel between one another.  When you call <b>EnclaveVerifyAttestationReport</b> from a virtualization-based security (VBS) enclave, you can only use <b>EnclaveVerifyAttestationReport</b> to validate an attestation report that another VBS enclave generated.

<b>EnclaveVerifyAttestationReport</b> must be called from within an enclave, and is only supported within enclaves that have the  <b>ENCLAVE_TYPE_VBS</b> enclave type.
