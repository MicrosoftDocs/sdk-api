# IWABObject::Import


## -description


Imports a .wab file into the user's Address Book.


## -parameters




### -param lpWIP

Type: <b>LPSTR</b>

Pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wabapi/ns-wabapi-wabimportparam">WABIMPORTPARAM</a> 
				structure.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

Returns S_OK if successful, or an error value otherwise.
			




## -remarks



When calling this method, pass a pointer to a 
	<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wabapi/ns-wabapi-wabimportparam">WABIMPORTPARAM</a> structure. If the caller specifies 
	<b>MAPI_DIALOG</b> in the 
	<b>ulFlags</b> member of the structure, 
	the Windows Address Book (WAB) shows a dialog box with a progress bar indicating 
	the progress of the import process. The caller can specify a file name 
	to import. If the caller specifies a <b>NULL</b> file name, the 
	WAB opens a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/commdlg/nf-commdlg-getopenfilenamea">GetOpenFileName</a> 
	dialog box to prompt the user to select a .wab file for importing.

For compatibility with previously released versions of the 
	WAB that expose this method, the pointer to the 
	<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wabapi/ns-wabapi-wabimportparam">WABIMPORTPARAM</a> structure needs to be cast to an 
	<b>LPSTR</b> prior to passing it into this method.
