# IWABObject::SetMe


## -description


Designates a particular contact as the ME object.


## -parameters




### -param lpIAB

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wabiab/nn-wabiab-iaddrbook">IAddrBook</a>*</b>

Pointer to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wabiab/nn-wabiab-iaddrbook">IAddrBook</a> interface 
				that specifies the address book.


### -param ulFlags

Type: <b>ULONG</b>

Value of type <b>ULONG</b> that specifies flags 
				affecting behavior.



#### MAPI_DIALOG

Causes a selection dialog box to be displayed.


### -param sbEID

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/office/developer/office-2007/cc815817(v=office.12)">SBinary</a></b>

Value of type <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/office/developer/office-2007/cc815817(v=office.12)">SBinary</a> that 
				specifies the entry identifier of the contact that should be tagged 
				as ME.


### -param hwnd

Type: <b>ULONG</b>

Value of type <b>ULONG</b> that specifies the 
				parent window handle for displaying dialog boxes. Cast the 
				parent <b>HWND</b> to a <b>ULONG</b> 
				before passing.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

Returns S_OK if successful, or an error code otherwise.




## -remarks



If the calling application provides an entry identifier to set as the ME object,
	 and <i>ulFlags</i> is set to zero, the entry corresponding 
	 to the entry identifier is designated as "ME" and any previous ME entry is cleared 
	 of this setting.

If the calling application specifies 
<b>MAPI_DIALOG</b> in the <i>ulFlags</i> parameter,
 the Windows Address Book (WAB) displays a ME selection dialog box which contains 
 a list of contacts from which the user can choose. If the application passed 
 in an entry identifier, the entry corresponding to the entry identifier is pre-selected 
 in the contact list. If the application did not pass in an entry identifier, 
 and a ME entry currently exists in the WAB, the current ME entry is 
 pre-selected in the contact list.

Passing a combination of no flags and no entry identifiers is not valid.
