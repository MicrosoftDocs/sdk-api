# DEVICE_POWER_DESCRIPTOR structure


## -description


The <b>DEVICE_POWER_DESCRIPTOR</b> 
    structure describes the power capabilities of a storage device.


## -struct-fields




### -field Version

Contains the size of this structure, in bytes. The value of this member will change as members are added to 
      the structure.


### -field Size

Specifies the total size of the data returned, in bytes. This may include data that follows this 
      structure.


### -field DeviceAttentionSupported

True if device attention is supported. Otherwise, false.


### -field AsynchronousNotificationSupported

True if the device supports asynchronous notifications, delivered via 
      <b>IOCTL_STORAGE_EVENT_NOTIFICATION</b>. Otherwise, false.


### -field IdlePowerManagementEnabled

True if the device has been registered for runtime idle power management. Otherwise, false.


### -field D3ColdEnabled

True if the device will be powered off when put into D3 power state. Otherwise, false.


### -field D3ColdSupported

True if the platform supports <b>D3ColdEnabled</b> for this device. Otherwise, 
      false.


### -field NoVerifyDuringIdlePower

 


### -field Reserved

Reserved.


### -field IdleTimeoutInMS

The idle timeout value in milliseconds. This member is ignored unless 
      <b>IdlePowerManagementEnabled</b> is true.
