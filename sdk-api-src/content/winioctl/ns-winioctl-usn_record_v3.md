# USN_RECORD_V3 structure


## -description


Contains the information for an update sequence number (USN) change journal version 3.0 
    record. The version 2.0 record is defined by the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winioctl/ns-winioctl-usn_record_v2">USN_RECORD_V2</a> structure (also called 
    <b>USN_RECORD</b> structure).


## -struct-fields




### -field RecordLength

The total length of a record, in bytes.

Because <b>USN_RECORD_V3</b> is a variable size, the 
       <b>RecordLength</b> member should be used when calculating the address of the next record 
       in an output buffer, for example,  a buffer that is returned from operations for the 
       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-deviceiocontrol">DeviceIoControl</a> function that work with 
       <b>USN_RECORD_V3</b>.

The size in bytes of any change 
       journal record is at most the size of the <b>USN_RECORD_V3</b> 
       structure, plus <i>MaximumComponentLength</i> characters minus 1 (for the character declared 
       in the structure) times the size of a wide character. The value of 
       <i>MaximumComponentLength</i> may be determined by calling the  
       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-getvolumeinformationa">GetVolumeInformation</a> function. In C, you can 
       determine a record size by using the following code example.

<div class="code"><span codelanguage="ManagedCPlusPlus"><table>
<tr>
<th>C++</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>  MaximumChangeJournalRecordSize = 
      QuadAlign( (MaximumComponentLength - 1) * sizeof(WCHAR) 
       + sizeof(USN_RECORD_V3) );
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
To maintain compatibility across version changes of the change journal software, use a run-time calculation 
       to determine the size of the <b>USN_RECORD_V3</b> structure. For 
       more information about compatibility across version changes, see the Remarks section in this topic.


### -field MajorVersion

The major version number of the change journal software for this record.

For example, if the change journal software is version 3.0, the major version number is 3.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt>2</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The structure is a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winioctl/ns-winioctl-usn_record_v2">USN_RECORD_V2</a> structure and the 
        remainder of the structure should be parsed using that layout.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt>3</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The structure is a <b>USN_RECORD_V3</b> structure and the 
        remainder of the structure should be parsed using that layout.

</td>

<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt>4</dt>
</dl>

<td width="60%">
The structure is a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winioctl/ns-winioctl-usn_record_v4">USN_RECORD_V4</a> structure and the remainder of the structure should be parsed using that layout.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field MinorVersion

The minor version number of the change journal software for this record. For example, if the change journal 
      software is version 3.0, the minor version number is zero.


### -field FileReferenceNumber

The 128-bit ordinal number of the file or directory for which this record notes changes.

This is an arbitrarily assigned value that associates a journal record with a file.


### -field ParentFileReferenceNumber

The 128-bit ordinal number of the directory where the file or directory that is associated with this record 
       is located.

This is an arbitrarily assigned value that associates a journal record with a parent directory.


### -field Usn

The USN of this record.


### -field TimeStamp

The standard UTC time stamp (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-filetime">FILETIME</a>) of this 
      record, in 64-bit format.


### -field Reason

The flags that identify reasons for changes that have accumulated in this file or directory journal record 
       since the file or directory opened.

When a file or directory closes, then a final USN record is generated with the 
       <b>USN_REASON_CLOSE</b> flag set. The next change (for example, after the next open 
       operation or deletion) starts a new record with a new set of reason flags.

A rename or move operation generates two USN records, one that records the old parent directory for the item, 
       and one that records a new parent.

The following  table identifies the possible flags.

### -field SourceInfo

Additional information about the source of the change, set by the 
       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winioctl/ni-winioctl-fsctl_mark_handle">FSCTL_MARK_HANDLE</a> of the 
       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-deviceiocontrol">DeviceIoControl</a> operation.

When a thread writes a new USN record, the source information flags in the prior record continues to be 
       present only if the thread also sets those flags.  Therefore, the source information structure allows 
       applications to filter out USN records that are set only by a known source, for example, an antivirus filter.

One of the two following values can be set. 

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>

<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="USN_SOURCE_AUXILIARY_DATA"></a><a id="usn_source_auxiliary_data"></a><dl>

<dt>0x00000002</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The operation adds a private data stream to a file or directory.

An example might be a virus detector adding checksum information. As the virus detector modifies the item, 
         the system generates USN records. <b>USN_SOURCE_AUXILIARY_DATA</b> indicates that the 
         modifications did not change the application data.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="USN_SOURCE_DATA_MANAGEMENT"></a><a id="usn_source_data_management"></a><dl>

The operation provides information about a change to the file or directory made by the operating system.

A typical use is when the Remote Storage system moves data from external to local storage. Remote Storage 
         is the hierarchical storage management software. Such a move usually at a minimum adds the 
         <b>USN_REASON_DATA_OVERWRITE</b> flag to a USN record. However, the data has not changed 
         from the user's point of view. By noting <b>USN_SOURCE_DATA_MANAGEMENT</b> in the 
         <b>SourceInfo</b> member, you can determine that although a write operation is performed 
         on the item, data has not changed.

### -field SecurityId

The unique security identifier assigned to the file or directory associated with this record.


### -field FileAttributes

The attributes for the file or directory associated with this record, as returned by the 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-getfileattributesa">GetFileAttributes</a> function. Attributes of streams 
      associated with the file or directory are excluded.


### -field FileNameLength

The length of the name of the file or directory associated with this record, in bytes. The 
      <b>FileName</b> member contains this name. Use this member to determine file name length, 
      rather than depending on a trailing '\0' to delimit the file name in <b>FileName</b>.


### -field FileNameOffset

The offset of the <b>FileName</b> member from the beginning of the structure.


### -field FileName

The name of the file or directory associated with this record in Unicode format. This file or directory name 
       is of variable length.

When working with <b>FileName</b>, do not count on the file name that contains a trailing 
       '\0' delimiter, but instead determine the length of the file name by using 
       <b>FileNameLength</b>.

Do not perform any compile-time pointer arithmetic using <b>FileName</b>. Instead, make 
       necessary calculations at run time by using the value of the <b>FileNameOffset</b> member. 
       Doing so helps make your code compatible with any future versions of 
       <b>USN_RECORD_V3</b>.


## -remarks



In output buffers returned from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-deviceiocontrol">DeviceIoControl</a> 
    operations that work with <b>USN_RECORD_V3</b>, all records are 
    aligned on 64-bit boundaries from the start of the buffer.

When range tracking is turned on, NTFS switches to producing only <b>USN_RECORD_V3</b> records as output.

To provide a path for upward compatibility in change journal clients, Microsoft provides a major and minor 
    version number of the change journal software in the 
    <b>USN_RECORD_V3</b> structure. Your code should examine these 
    values, detect its own compatibility with the change journal software, and if necessary gracefully handle any 
    incompatibility.

A change in the minor version number indicates that the existing 
    <b>USN_RECORD_V3</b> structure members are still valid, but that new 
    members may have been added between the penultimate member and the last, which is a variable-length string.

To handle such a change gracefully, your code should not do any compile-time pointer arithmetic that relies on 
    the location of the last member. For example, this makes the C code 
    <code>sizeof(USN_RECORD)</code> unreliable. Instead, rely on run-time calculations by 
    using the <b>RecordLength</b> member.

An increase in the major version number of the change journal software indicates that the 
    <b>USN_RECORD_V3</b> structure may have undergone major changes, and 
    that the current definition may not be reliable. If your code detects a change in the major version number of the 
    change journal software, it should not work with the change journal.
