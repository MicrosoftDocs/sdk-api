# STORAGE_PHYSICAL_TOPOLOGY_DESCRIPTOR structure


## -description


The <b>STORAGE_PHYSICAL_TOPOLOGY_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure is one of the query result structures returned from an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winioctl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_storage_query_property">IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY</a> request. This structure describes storage device physical topology.


## -struct-fields




### -field Version

Contains the size of this structure, in bytes. Set to <code>sizeof(STORAGE_PHYSICAL_TOPOLOGY_DESCRIPTOR)</code>.


### -field Size

Specifies the total size of the data, in bytes. Should be &gt;= <code>sizeof(STORAGE_PHYSICAL_TOPOLOGY_DESCRIPTOR)</code>.


### -field NodeCount

Specifies the number of nodes.


### -field Reserved

Reserved.


### -field Node

 




#### - Node[ANYSIZE_ARRAY]

A node as specified by a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winioctl/ns-winioctl-storage_physical_node_data">STORAGE_PHYSICAL_NODE_DATA</a> structure.
