# FSCTL_REQUEST_BATCH_OPLOCK IOCTL

## -description

Requests a batch opportunistic lock on a file.

To perform this operation, call the [**DeviceIoControl**](../ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-deviceiocontrol.md) function using the following arguments.

```cpp
BOOL b = DeviceIoControl(
  (HANDLE) hDevice,              // handle to file
  FSCTL_REQUEST_BATCH_OPLOCK,    // dwIoControlCode
  NULL,                          // lpInBuffer
  0,                             // nInBufferSize
  NULL,                          // lpOutBuffer
  0,                             // nOutBufferSize
  (LPDWORD) lpBytesReturned,     // number of bytes returned
  (LPOVERLAPPED) lpOverlapped ); // OVERLAPPED structure
```

## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer


### -input-buffer-length


### -output-buffer


### -output-buffer-length


### -in-out-buffer


### -inout-buffer-length


### -status-block

Irp->IoStatus.Status is set to STATUS_SUCCESS if the request is successful.

Otherwise, Status to the appropriate error condition as a NTSTATUS code. 

For more information, see [NTSTATUS Values](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/ntstatus-values).

## -remarks

This operation is used only by client applications requesting an opportunistic lock (oplock) from a local server. Client applications requesting opportunistic locks from remote servers must not request them directly—the network redirector transparently requests opportunistic locks for the application. An attempt to use this operation to request opportunistic locks from remote servers will result in the request being denied.

If a new oplock type is desired, the handle must be closed and a new handle reopened using [CreateFile](../fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea.md), and [DeviceIoControl](../ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-deviceiocontrol.md) must be called on the new handle with the desired **FSCTL_REQUEST_OPLOCK**_\_XXX_ control code. To request an oplock on a handle that can have the oplock type changed in place (the handle does not have to be closed and reopened), use the [FSCTL_REQUEST_OPLOCK](ni-winioctl-fsctl_request_oplock.md) control code.

Use **FSCTL_REQUEST_BATCH_OPLOCK** to request a batch opportunistic lock on a file. A client file system can cache read data, write data, and handle data locally as long as the level 1 lock is held.

The batch oplock owner must acknowledge an oplock break (see [Breaking opportunistic locks](/windows/win32/fileio/breaking-opportunistic-locks)) before any operation that is incompatible with a batch oplock can go through on another handle. After the lock is broken, the network redirector is notified not to regard as valid any cached data from the file.

For more information, see [Types of Opportunistic Locks](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/types-of-opportunistic-locks).

For a comparison of the various oplock control codes, see [FSCTL_REQUEST_OPLOCK](ni-winioctl-fsctl_request_oplock.md).

An **FSCTL_REQUEST_BATCH_OPLOCK** control code fails if the file is opened in non-overlapped (synchronous) mode.

For the implications of overlapped I/O on this operation, see the Remarks section of the [DeviceIoControl](../ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-deviceiocontrol.md) topic.
