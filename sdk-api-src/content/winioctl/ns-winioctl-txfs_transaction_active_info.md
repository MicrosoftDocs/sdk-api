<p class="CCE_Message">[Microsoft strongly recommends developers utilize alternative means to achieve your 
    application’s needs. Many scenarios that TxF was developed for can be achieved through simpler and more readily 
    available techniques. Furthermore, TxF may not be available in future versions of Microsoft Windows. For more 
    information, and alternatives to TxF, please see 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/deprecation-of-txf">Alternatives to using Transactional NTFS</a>.]
