Otherwise, Status to the appropriate error condition as a NTSTATUS code.

## -remarks



For the implications of overlapped I/O on this operation, see the Remarks section of the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-deviceiocontrol">DeviceIoControl</a> topic.

You can use <b>FSCTL_DELETE_USN_JOURNAL</b> to delete 
    a change journal. The NTFS file system starts a deletion operation and returns immediately to the calling process, 
    unless the <b>USN_DELETE_FLAG_NOTIFY</b> flag is set in the 
    <b>DeleteFlags</b> member of 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winioctl/ns-winioctl-delete_usn_journal_data">DELETE_USN_JOURNAL_DATA</a>.

If the <b>USN_DELETE_FLAG_NOTIFY</b> and <b>USN_DELETE_FLAG_DELETE</b> 
    flags are both set, a call to 
    <b>FSCTL_DELETE_USN_JOURNAL</b> begins the deletion 
    process. Then the call either blocks the calling thread and waits for the deletion (on a synchronous or 
    non-overlapped call), or sets up event notification by using an I/O completion port or other mechanism, and 
    returns (on an asynchronous or overlapped call).

You can also use <b>FSCTL_DELETE_USN_JOURNAL</b> to 
    receive notification that a change journal deletion is complete, by setting only 
    <b>USN_DELETE_FLAG_NOTIFY</b>. If you do so, the 
    <b>FSCTL_DELETE_USN_JOURNAL</b> operation either waits 
    until the deletion completes before returning (on a synchronous or non-overlapped call), or sets up event 
    notification by using an I/O completion port or other mechanism (on an asynchronous or overlapped call).

The deletion on which an application receives notification may have been initiated by the current process, or 
    some other process. For example, when an application is started, it can use 
    <b>FSCTL_DELETE_USN_JOURNAL</b> to determine if a 
    deletion started by some other process is in progress and if it is, exit.

Complete deletion of a change journal requires a scan of the volume where the change journal resides, which 
    may take a long time on a volume with many files. The operation continues to completion even across system 
    restarts. Attempts to create, modify, delete, or query the change journal while deletion is in progress fail and 
    return the error code <b>ERROR_JOURNAL_DELETE_IN_PROGRESS</b>.

The <b>FSCTL_DELETE_USN_JOURNAL</b> operation has a 
    significant performance cost, so it should be used sparingly. An administrator should delete a journal when the 
    current USN value approaches that of the maximum possible USN value.

For more information, see 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/creating-modifying-and-deleting-a-change-journal">Creating, Modifying, and Deleting a Change Journal</a>.

To retrieve a handle to a volume, call 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea">CreateFile</a> with the 
     <i>lpFileName</i> parameter set to a string in the following form:

\\.\<i>X</i>:

In the preceding string, <i>X</i> is the letter identifying the drive on which the volume 
     appears. The volume must be NTFS.

In Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, this code is supported by the following technologies.
