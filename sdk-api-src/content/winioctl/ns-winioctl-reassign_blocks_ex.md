# REASSIGN_BLOCKS_EX structure


## -description


Contains 
    disk block reassignment data. This is a variable length structure where the last member is an array of block 
    numbers to be reassigned. It is used by the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winioctl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_disk_reassign_blocks_ex">IOCTL_DISK_REASSIGN_BLOCKS_EX</a> control 
    code.


## -struct-fields




### -field Reserved

This member is reserved. Do not use it. Set it to 0 (zero).


### -field Count

The number of blocks to be reassigned. 

This is the number of elements that are in the 
      <b>BlockNumber</b> member array.


### -field BlockNumber

An array of <b>Count</b> block numbers, one for each block to be reassigned.


## -remarks



The <b>REASSIGN_BLOCKS_EX</b> structure supports drives 
    that have an 8-byte Logical Block Address (LBA), which is typically required for storage devices larger than 2 TB. 
    The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winioctl/ns-winioctl-reassign_blocks">REASSIGN_BLOCKS</a> structure used with the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winioctl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_disk_reassign_blocks">IOCTL_DISK_REASSIGN_BLOCKS</a> control code 
    supports devices with up to a 4-byte LBA should be used where possible.
