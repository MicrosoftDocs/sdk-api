# STORAGE_PHYSICAL_NODE_DATA structure


## -description


Specifies the physical device data of a storage node.


## -struct-fields




### -field NodeId

The hardware ID of the storage node.


### -field AdapterCount

A value of 0 or 1 that indicates the adapter count in the storage node.


### -field AdapterDataLength

The data length of the storage adapter in the storage node,  in units of kilobytes (1024 bytes).


### -field AdapterDataOffset

The data offset from the beginning of the data structure. The buffer contains an array of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winioctl/ns-winioctl-storage_physical_adapter_data">STORAGE_PHYSICAL_ADAPTER_DATA</a>.


### -field DeviceCount

A value less than or equal to 1.


### -field DeviceDataLength

The data length of the storage device in the storage node,  in units of kilobytes (1024 bytes).


### -field DeviceDataOffset

The data offset from the beginning of the data structure. The buffer contains an array of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winioctl/ns-winioctl-storage_physical_device_data">STORAGE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_DATA</a>.


### -field Reserved

 




#### - Reserved[3]

Specifies if the storage adapter is reserved.
