# IVMRSurfaceAllocator9 interface


## -description

The <b>IVMRSurfaceAllocator9</b> interface is implemented by the default allocator-presenter for the <a href="/windows/desktop/DirectShow/video-mixing-renderer-filter-9">Video Mixing Renderer Filter 9</a> (VMR-9). It must also be implemented by any plug-in allocator-presenter object that an application provides to the VMR-9. The VMR-9 uses the methods on this interface to allocate, prepare and free Direct3D surfaces. Applications do not use this interface.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IVMRSurfaceAllocator9</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IVMRSurfaceAllocator9</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

Include DShow.h and D3d9.h before Vmr9.h.
