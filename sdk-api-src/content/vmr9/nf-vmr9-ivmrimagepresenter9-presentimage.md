# IVMRImagePresenter9::PresentImage


## -description

The <code>PresentImage</code> method is called at precisely the moment this video frame should be presented.

## -parameters

### -param dwUserID [in]

An application-defined DWORD_PTR that uniquely identifies this instance of the VMR in scenarios when multiple instances of the VMR are being used with a single instance of an allocator-presenter. See Remarks.

### -param lpPresInfo [in]

Specifies a <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/vmr9/ns-vmr9-vmr9presentationinfo">VMR9PresentationInfo</a> structure that contains information about the video frame.

## -returns

The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. Possible values include those in the following table.

<td width="60%">

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## -remarks

<code>PresentImage</code> can be called when the filter is in either a running or a paused state. <b>StartPresenting</b> and <b>StopPresenting</b> can be called only in a running state. Therefore, if the graph is paused before it is run, <code>PresentImage</code> will be called before <b>StartPresenting</b>.

Applications can create custom blending effects by using a single instance of an allocator-presenter with multiple instances of the VMR either in a single filter graph or in multiple filter graphs. Using the allocator presenter in this way enables applications to blend streams from different filter graphs, or blend different streams within the same filter graph. If you are using a single instance of the VMR, set this value to zero.

Include DShow.h and D3d9.h before Vmr9.h.
