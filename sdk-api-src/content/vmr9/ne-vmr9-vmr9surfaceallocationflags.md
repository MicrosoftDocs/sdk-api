# VMR9SurfaceAllocationFlags enumeration


## -description



The <b>VMR9SurfaceAllocationFlags</b> enumeration type is used with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vmr9/nf-vmr9-ivmrsurfaceallocator9-initializedevice">IVMRSurfaceAllocator9::InitializeDevice</a> method to specify surface creation parameters (VMR-9 only).




## -enum-fields




### -field VMR9AllocFlag_3DRenderTarget

Indicates that the surface is a Direct3D render target.


### -field VMR9AllocFlag_DXVATarget

Indicates that the render target supports DXVA.


### -field VMR9AllocFlag_TextureSurface

Indicates that the target is a Direct3D texture surface.


### -field VMR9AllocFlag_OffscreenSurface

Indicates an offscreen surface.


### -field VMR9AllocFlag_RGBDynamicSwitch

In YUV mixing mode, indicates that the mixer can accept RGB formats in addition to the specified YUV format. The allocator-presenter can switch between the formats dynamically. This flag is only valid in YUV mixing mode.


### -field VMR9AllocFlag_UsageReserved

Reserved for future use.


### -field VMR9AllocFlag_UsageMask

Bitwise <b>OR</b> of all flags; not used by applications


## -remarks



The VMR9AllocFlag_TextureSurface flag can be combined with the VMR9AllocFlag_DXVATarget and VMR9AllocFlag_3DRenderTarget flags.
