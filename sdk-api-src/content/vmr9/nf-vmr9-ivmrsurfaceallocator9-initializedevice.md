# IVMRSurfaceAllocator9::InitializeDevice


## -description

The <b>InitializeDevice</b> method is called by the Video Mixing Renderer 9 (VMR-9) when it needs the allocator-presenter to allocate surfaces.

## -parameters

### -param dwUserID [in]

Application-defined identifier. This value is the same value that the application passed to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vmr9/nf-vmr9-ivmrsurfaceallocatornotify9-advisesurfaceallocator">IVMRSurfaceAllocatorNotify9::AdviseSurfaceAllocator</a> method in the <i>dwUserID</i> parameter.

### -param lpAllocInfo [in]

Pointer to a <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/vmr9/ns-vmr9-vmr9allocationinfo">VMR9AllocationInfo</a> structure that contains a description of the surfaces to create.

### -param lpNumBuffers [in, out]

On input, specifies the number of surfaces to create. When the method returns, this parameter contains the number of buffers that were actually allocated.

## -returns

The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. Possible values include those in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>

<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method succeeded.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## -remarks

Implement this method if you are providing a custom allocator-presenter for the VMR-9. You can use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vmr9/nf-vmr9-ivmrsurfaceallocatornotify9-allocatesurfacehelper">IVMRSurfaceAllocatorNotify9::AllocateSurfaceHelper</a> method on the VMR-9 to allocate the surfaces.

Include DShow.h and D3d9.h before Vmr9.h.
