# IVMRSurface9 interface


## -description

The <code>IVMRSurface9</code> interface is implemented on the media samples used by the <a href="/windows/desktop/DirectShow/video-mixing-renderer-filter-9">Video Mixing Renderer Filter 9</a>. Filters can use this interface to access the underlying Direct3D surface on which the media sample is based. Filters must always lock and unlock the surface using the methods available on this interface. Filters must never call lock or unlock directly on the Direct3D surface interface returned from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nf-strmif-ivmrsurface-getsurface">GetSurface</a> method. Applications do not use this interface.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IVMRSurface9</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IVMRSurface9</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

Include DShow.h and D3d9.h before Vmr9.h.
