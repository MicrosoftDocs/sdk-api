# CHString::SpanIncluding


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/chstring">CHString</a> class 
    is part of the WMI Provider Framework which is now considered in final state, and no further development, 
    enhancements, or updates will be available for non-security related issues affecting these libraries. The 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/wmi_v2/windows-management-infrastructure">MI APIs</a> should be used for all new 
    development.]

The <b>SpanIncluding</b> method extracts characters of a string that are identified by <i>lpszCharSet</i>.


## -parameters




### -param lpszCharSet

A string interpreted as a set of characters.


## -returns



The <b>SpanIncluding</b> method returns a substring that contains characters in the string that are in <i>lpszCharSet</i>.

If the first character in the string is not in the specified set, the method returns an empty substring.




## -remarks



The <b>SpanIncluding</b> method starts with the first character of the string and stops when a character is found in the string but not in <i>lpszCharSet</i>.


#### Examples

The following code example shows the use of <b>CHString::SpanIncluding</b>.


```cpp
CHString str( L"cabbage" );
CHString res = str.SpanIncluding( L"abc" );

assert( res == L"cabba" );
res = str.SpanIncluding( L"xyz" );
assert( res.IsEmpty( ) );
```
