# CHString::FreeExtra


## -description

<p class="CCE_Message">[The <a href="/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/chstring">CHString</a> class 
    is part of the WMI Provider Framework which is now considered in final state, and no further development, 
    enhancements, or updates will be available for non-security related issues affecting these libraries. The 
    <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/wmi_v2/windows-management-infrastructure">MI APIs</a> should be used for all new 
    development.]

The <b>FreeExtra</b> method frees any extra memory that was previously allocated by the string but is no longer needed. This method, which reallocates the buffer to the exact length returned by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/chstring/nf-chstring-chstring-getlength">GetLength</a>, should reduce the memory overhead consumed by the string object.

## -parameters

## -returns

This method does not return a value.
