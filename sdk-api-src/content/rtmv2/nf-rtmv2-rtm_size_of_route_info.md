# RTM_SIZE_OF_ROUTE_INFO macro


## -description

The 
<b>RTM_SIZE_OF_ROUTE_INFO</b> macro returns the size of the route information structure, 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/rtmv2/ns-rtmv2-rtm_route_info">RTM_ROUTE_INFO</a>. The size of this structure is variable, and is based on the number of next hops associated with the route. Use this macro when allocating memory for route structures.

## -parameters

### -param NumHops

Specifies the number of next hops in the route structure.

## -remarks

If the client  only allocates one next hop per route, the client can allocate an 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/rtmv2/ns-rtmv2-rtm_route_info">RTM_ROUTE_INFO</a> structure statically.

The macro is defined as follows:


```cpp
#include <windows.h>

#define RTM_SIZE_OF_ROUTE_INFO(NumHops)                     \
    FIELD_OFFSET(RTM_ROUTE_INFO, NextHopsList.NumNextHops)

#define RTM_BASIC_ROUTE_INFO_SIZE                           \
    (RTM_BASIC_ROUTE_INFO_SIZE + (NumHops) *                \
     sizeof(RTM_NEXTHOP_HANDLE))

```
