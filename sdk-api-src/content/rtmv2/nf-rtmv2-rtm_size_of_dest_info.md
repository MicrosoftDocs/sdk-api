# RTM_SIZE_OF_DEST_INFO macro


## -description

The 
<b>RTM_SIZE_OF_DEST_INFO</b> macro returns the size of the destination information structure (<a href="/windows/desktop/api/rtmv2/ns-rtmv2-rtm_dest_info">RTM_DEST_INFO</a>). The size of this structure is variable, and is based on the number of views for which it contains information. Use this macro when allocating memory for destination information.

## -parameters

### -param NumViews

Specifies the number of views in the destination structure.

## -remarks

If the client  only uses one view per destination, the client can allocate an 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/rtmv2/ns-rtmv2-rtm_dest_info">RTM_DEST_INFO</a> structure statically.

The macro is defined as follows:


```cpp
#include <windows.h>

#define RTM_DEST_VIEW_INFO_SIZE                             \
    FIELD_OFFSET(RTM_DEST_INFO, ViewInfo)

#define RTM_SIZE_OF_DEST_INFO(NumViews)                     \
    (sizeof(RTM_DEST_INFO) - RTM_BASIC_DEST_INFO_SIZE)

#define RTM_BASIC_DEST_INFO_SIZE                            \
    (RTM_BASIC_DEST_INFO_SIZE + (NumViews) *                \
    RTM_DEST_VIEW_INFO_SIZE)

```
