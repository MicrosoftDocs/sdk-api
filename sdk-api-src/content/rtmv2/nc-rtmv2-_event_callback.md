</td>
<td width="60%">

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -param Context1

For RTM_ENTITY_REGISTERED calls: Contains the handle to the entity that registered. 




For RTM_ENTITY_DEREGISTERED calls: Contains the handle to the entity that unregistered.

For RTM_ROUTE_EXPIRED calls: Contains the handle to the route that timed out.

For RTM_CHANGE_NOTIFICATION calls: Contains the handle to the change notification.


### -param Context2

For RTM_ENTITY_REGISTERED calls: Contains a pointer to the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/rtmv2/ns-rtmv2-rtm_entity_info">RTM_ENTITY_INFO</a> structure referred to by the handle in <i>Context1</i>. If the client must retain this information, the client must copy it to a structure it has allocated. 




For RTM_ENTITY_DEREGISTERED calls: Contains a pointer to the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/rtmv2/ns-rtmv2-rtm_entity_info">RTM_ENTITY_INFO</a> structure referred to by the handle in <i>Context1</i>. If the client must retain this information, the client must copy it to a structure it has allocated.

For RTM_ROUTE_EXPIRED calls: Contains a pointer to the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/rtmv2/ns-rtmv2-rtm_route_info">RTM_ROUTE_INFO</a> structure referred to by the handle in <i>Context1</i>. If the client must retain this information, the client must copy it to a structure it has allocated.

For RTM_CHANGE_NOTIFICATION calls: Contains the notification context that was given to the client by a previous call to 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/rtmv2/nf-rtmv2-rtmregisterforchangenotification">RtmRegisterForChangeNotification</a>.


## -returns



If the routing table manager issues an RTM_ROUTE_EXPIRED callback, and the client returns to the routing table manager the value ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED, the routing table manager will delete the route from the routing table.

All other errors returned by the client are ignored.




## -remarks



After a client has registered for change notification, the routing table manager uses this callback to keep the client informed about events.

If a client receives an 
<b>RTM_EVENT_CALLBACK</b> for the RTM_ENTITY_REGISTERED or RTM_ENTITY_DEREGISTERED events, the client must not make calls to 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/rtmv2/nf-rtmv2-rtmregisterentity">RtmRegisterEntity</a>, 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/rtmv2/nf-rtmv2-rtmderegisterentity">RtmDeregisterEntity</a>, or 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/rtmv2/nf-rtmv2-rtmgetregisteredentities">RtmGetRegisteredEntities</a> in the context of this callback.

If a client receives an 
<b>RTM_EVENT_CALLBACK</b> for the RTM_CHANGE_NOTIFICATION event, the client must not call 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/rtmv2/nf-rtmv2-rtmregisterforchangenotification">RtmRegisterForChangeNotification</a> in the context of this callback.
