# IWMWriterSink interface


## -description

The <b>IWMWriterSink</b> interface is the basic interface of all writer sinks, including the file, network, and push sinks defined in the Windows Media Format SDK, and custom sinks. If you are using one of the defined writer sinks, you never need to deal with the methods of this interface. If you are creating your own custom writer sink, you must implement these methods in your application.

This interface exists on the writer file sink object, the writer network sink object, and the writer push sink object. You should never obtain a pointer to this interface from one of these objects, however, as its methods are called internally by the writer sink objects and the writer object. You can create a class in your application that inherits from this interface to make your own sink.

## -inheritance

The <b>IWMWriterSink</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IWMWriterSink</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>
