# WMT_STATUS enumeration


## -description

The <b>WMT_STATUS</b> enumeration type defines a range of file status information. Members of <b>WMT_STATUS</b> are passed to the common callback function, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmstatuscallback-onstatus">IWMStatusCallback::OnStatus</a>, so that the application can respond to the changing status of the objects being used.

## -enum-fields

### -field WMT_ERROR:0

An error occurred.

### -field WMT_OPENED:1

A file was opened.

### -field WMT_BUFFERING_START:2

The reader object is beginning to buffer content.

### -field WMT_BUFFERING_STOP:3

The reader object has finished buffering content.

### -field WMT_EOF:4

The end of the file has been reached. Both this member and the next one, <b>WMT_END_OF_FILE</b>, have the value 4.

### -field WMT_END_OF_FILE:4

The end of the file has been reached. Both this member and the previous one, <b>WMT_EOF</b>, have the value 4.

### -field WMT_END_OF_SEGMENT:5

The end of a segment has been encountered.

### -field WMT_END_OF_STREAMING:6

The end of a server-side playlist has been reached.

### -field WMT_LOCATING:7

The reader object is locating requested data.

### -field WMT_CONNECTING:8

A reporting object is connecting to server.

### -field WMT_NO_RIGHTS:9

There is no <a href="/windows/desktop/wmformat/wmformat-glossary">license</a> and the content is protected by version 1 digital rights management.

### -field WMT_MISSING_CODEC:10

The file loaded in the reader object contains compressed data for which no codec could be found. The <i>pValue</i> parameter in <b>OnStatus</b> contains a GUID. The first DWORD of this GUID contains the FOURCC or the format tag of the missing codec. The remaining bytes of the GUID can be ignored.

The <i>hr</i> parameter in <b>OnStatus</b> may equal S_OK, although a missing codec would normally be considered an error. Also, this event may be followed by WMT_STARTED with <i>hr</i> equal to S_OK, even if codecs are missing for every stream in the file. In that case, however, the application will not receive any decoded samples, and should stop the reader object.

### -field WMT_STARTED:11

A reporting object has begun operations.

### -field WMT_STOPPED:12

A reporting object has ceased operations.

### -field WMT_CLOSED:13

A file was closed.

### -field WMT_STRIDING:14

The reader object is playing content at above normal speed, or in reverse.

### -field WMT_TIMER:15

Timer event.

### -field WMT_INDEX_PROGRESS:16

Progress update from the indexer object.

### -field WMT_SAVEAS_START:17

The reader object has begun saving a file from a server.

### -field WMT_SAVEAS_STOP:18

The reader has stopped saving a file from a server.

### -field WMT_NEW_SOURCEFLAGS:19

The current file's header object contains certain attributes that are different from those of the previous file. This event is sent when playing a server-side playlist. Use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nn-wmsdkidl-iwmheaderinfo">IWMHeaderInfo</a> interface to query for any of the following attributes in a new file: <a href="/windows/desktop/wmformat/stridable">Stridable</a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/wmformat/broadcast">Broadcast</a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/wmformat/seekable">Seekable</a>, and <a href="/windows/desktop/wmformat/hasimage">HasImage</a>.

### -field WMT_NEW_METADATA:20

The current file's header object contains metadata attributes that are different from those of the previous file. This event is sent when playing a server-side playlist. Use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nn-wmsdkidl-iwmheaderinfo">IWMHeaderInfo</a> interface to query for any metadata attribute you are interested in.

### -field WMT_BACKUPRESTORE_BEGIN:21

A <a href="/windows/desktop/wmformat/wmformat-glossary">license</a> backup or restore has started.

### -field WMT_SOURCE_SWITCH:22

The file loaded in the reader object cannot be played without a security update.

### -field WMT_NO_RIGHTS_EX:26

There is no <a href="/windows/desktop/wmformat/wmformat-glossary">license</a> and the content is protected by version 7 digital rights management.

### -field WMT_BACKUPRESTORE_END:27

A <a href="/windows/desktop/wmformat/wmformat-glossary">license</a> backup or restore has finished.

### -field WMT_BACKUPRESTORE_CONNECTING:28

The backup restorer object is connecting to a server.

### -field WMT_BACKUPRESTORE_DISCONNECTING:29

The backup restorer object is disconnecting from a server.

### -field WMT_ERROR_WITHURL:30

Error relating to the URL.

### -field WMT_RESTRICTED_LICENSE:31

The backup restorer object cannot back up one or more <a href="/windows/desktop/wmformat/wmformat-glossary">licenses</a> because the right has been disallowed by the content owner.

### -field WMT_CLIENT_CONNECT:32

Sent when a client (a playing application or server) connects to a writer network sink object. The <i>pValue</i> parameter of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmstatuscallback-onstatus">IWMStatusCallback::OnStatus</a> callback is set to a <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/ns-wmsdkidl-wm_client_properties">WM_CLIENT_PROPERTIES</a> structure. New applications should wait for <b>WMT_CLIENT_CONNECT_EX</b> instead.

### -field WMT_CLIENT_DISCONNECT:33

Sent when a client (a playing application or server) disconnects from a writer network sink object. The <i>pValue</i> parameter of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmstatuscallback-onstatus">IWMStatusCallback::OnStatus</a> callback is set to a <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/ns-wmsdkidl-wm_client_properties">WM_CLIENT_PROPERTIES</a> structure. The values in this structure are identical to those sent on connection. New applications should wait for <b>WMT_CLIENT_DISCONNECT_EX</b> instead.

### -field WMT_NATIVE_OUTPUT_PROPS_CHANGED:34

Change in output properties.

### -field WMT_RECONNECT_START:35

Start of automatic reconnection to a server.

### -field WMT_RECONNECT_END:36

End of automatic reconnection to a server.

### -field WMT_CLIENT_CONNECT_EX:37

Sent when a client (a playing application or server) connects to a writer network sink object. The <i>pValue</i> parameter of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmstatuscallback-onstatus">IWMStatusCallback::OnStatus</a> callback is set to a <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/ns-wmsdkidl-wm_client_propertiesex">WM_CLIENT_PROPERTIES_EX</a> structure.

### -field WMT_CLIENT_DISCONNECT_EX:38

Sent when a client (a playing application or server) disconnects from a writer network sink object. The <i>pValue</i> parameter of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmstatuscallback-onstatus">IWMStatusCallback::OnStatus</a> callback is set to a <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/ns-wmsdkidl-wm_client_propertiesex">WM_CLIENT_PROPERTIES_EX</a> structure. The client properties are identical to those sent on connection except for the <b>pwszDNSName</b> member, which may have changed.

Change to the forward error correction span.

### -field WMT_PREROLL_READY:40

The reader is ready to begin buffering content.

### -field WMT_PREROLL_COMPLETE:41

The <i>pValue</i> parameter of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmstatuscallback-onstatus">IWMStatusCallback::OnStatus</a> callback is set to a <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/ns-wmsdkidl-wm_client_propertiesex">WM_CLIENT_PROPERTIES_EX</a> structure. This usually means that a DNS name is present for a client for which none was available at connection.

### -field WMT_LICENSEURL_SIGNATURE_STATE:43

Sent before a <b>WMT_NO_RIGHTS</b> or <b>WMT_NO_RIGHTS_EX</b> status message. The <i>pValue</i> parameter is set to one of the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/ne-wmsdkidl-wmt_drmla_trust">WMT_DRMLA_TRUST</a> constants indicating whether the <a href="/windows/desktop/wmformat/wmformat-glossary">license acquisition</a> URL is completely trusted.
