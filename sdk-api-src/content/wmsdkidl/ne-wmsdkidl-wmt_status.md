# WMT_STATUS enumeration


## -description



The <b>WMT_STATUS</b> enumeration type defines a range of file status information. Members of <b>WMT_STATUS</b> are passed to the common callback function, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmstatuscallback-onstatus">IWMStatusCallback::OnStatus</a>, so that the application can respond to the changing status of the objects being used.




## -enum-fields




### -field WMT_ERROR

An error occurred.


### -field WMT_OPENED

A file was opened.


### -field WMT_BUFFERING_START

The reader object is beginning to buffer content.


### -field WMT_BUFFERING_STOP

The reader object has finished buffering content.


### -field WMT_EOF

The end of the file has been reached. Both this member and the next one, <b>WMT_END_OF_FILE</b>, have the value 4.


### -field WMT_END_OF_FILE

The end of the file has been reached. Both this member and the previous one, <b>WMT_EOF</b>, have the value 4.


### -field WMT_END_OF_SEGMENT

The end of a segment has been encountered.


### -field WMT_END_OF_STREAMING

The end of a server-side playlist has been reached.


### -field WMT_LOCATING

The reader object is locating requested data.


### -field WMT_CONNECTING

A reporting object is connecting to server.


### -field WMT_NO_RIGHTS

There is no <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/wmformat/wmformat-glossary">license</a> and the content is protected by version 1 digital rights management.


### -field WMT_MISSING_CODEC

The file loaded in the reader object contains compressed data for which no codec could be found. The <i>pValue</i> parameter in <b>OnStatus</b> contains a GUID. The first DWORD of this GUID contains the FOURCC or the format tag of the missing codec. The remaining bytes of the GUID can be ignored.

The <i>hr</i> parameter in <b>OnStatus</b> may equal S_OK, although a missing codec would normally be considered an error. Also, this event may be followed by WMT_STARTED with <i>hr</i> equal to S_OK, even if codecs are missing for every stream in the file. In that case, however, the application will not receive any decoded samples, and should stop the reader object.


### -field WMT_STARTED

A reporting object has begun operations.


### -field WMT_STOPPED

A reporting object has ceased operations.


### -field WMT_CLOSED

A file was closed.


### -field WMT_STRIDING

### -field WMT_TIMER

Timer event.


### -field WMT_INDEX_PROGRESS

Progress update from the indexer object.


### -field WMT_SAVEAS_START

The reader object has begun saving a file from a server.


### -field WMT_SAVEAS_STOP

The reader has stopped saving a file from a server.


### -field WMT_NEW_SOURCEFLAGS

The current file's header object contains certain attributes that are different from those of the previous file. This event is sent when playing a server-side playlist. Use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nn-wmsdkidl-iwmheaderinfo">IWMHeaderInfo</a> interface to query for any of the following attributes in a new file: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/wmformat/stridable">Stridable</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/wmformat/broadcast">Broadcast</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/wmformat/seekable">Seekable</a>, and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/wmformat/hasimage">HasImage</a>.


### -field WMT_NEW_METADATA

The current file's header object contains metadata attributes that are different from those of the previous file. This event is sent when playing a server-side playlist. Use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nn-wmsdkidl-iwmheaderinfo">IWMHeaderInfo</a> interface to query for any metadata attribute you are interested in.


### -field WMT_BACKUPRESTORE_BEGIN

### -field WMT_NEEDS_INDIVIDUALIZATION

The file loaded in the reader object cannot be played without a security update.


### -field WMT_NO_RIGHTS_EX

There is no <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/wmformat/wmformat-glossary">license</a> and the content is protected by version 7 digital rights management.


### -field WMT_BACKUPRESTORE_END

A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/wmformat/wmformat-glossary">license</a> backup or restore has finished.


### -field WMT_BACKUPRESTORE_CONNECTING

The backup restorer object is connecting to a server.


### -field WMT_BACKUPRESTORE_DISCONNECTING

The backup restorer object is disconnecting from a server.


### -field WMT_ERROR_WITHURL

Error relating to the URL.


### -field WMT_RESTRICTED_LICENSE

The backup restorer object cannot back up one or more <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/wmformat/wmformat-glossary">licenses</a> because the right has been disallowed by the content owner.

New applications should wait for <b>WMT_CLIENT_CONNECT_EX</b> instead.


### -field WMT_CLIENT_DISCONNECT

The <i>pValue</i> parameter of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmstatuscallback-onstatus">IWMStatusCallback::OnStatus</a> callback is set to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/ns-wmsdkidl-wm_client_properties">WM_CLIENT_PROPERTIES</a> structure. The values in this structure are identical to those sent on connection. New applications should wait for <b>WMT_CLIENT_DISCONNECT_EX</b> instead.


### -field WMT_NATIVE_OUTPUT_PROPS_CHANGED
