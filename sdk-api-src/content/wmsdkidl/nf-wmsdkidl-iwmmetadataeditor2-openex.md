# IWMMetadataEditor2::OpenEx


## -description



The <b>OpenEx</b> method opens a file for use by the metadata editor object. <b>OpenEx</b> opens ASF files and MP3 files, though the metadata editor has limited capabilities when working with MP3 files.




## -parameters




### -param pwszFilename [in]

Pointer to a wide-character null-terminated string containing the file name.


### -param dwDesiredAccess [in]

<b>DWORD</b> containing the desired access type. This can be set to GENERIC_READ or GENERIC_WRITE. For read/write access, pass both values combined with a bitwise <b>OR</b>. When using GENERIC_READ, you must also pass a valid sharing mode as <i>dwShareMode</i>. Failure to do so will result in an error.


### -param dwShareMode [in]

<b>DWORD</b> containing the sharing mode. This can be one of the values in the following table or a combination of the two using a bitwise <b>OR</b>. A value of zero indicates no sharing. Sharing is not supported when requesting read/write access. If you request read/write access and pass any value other than zero for the share mode, an error is returned.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value
                </th>
<th>Description
                </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FILE_SHARE_READ</td>
<td>Subsequent open operations on the file will succeed only if read access is requested.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FILE_SHARE_DELETE</td>
<td>(NTFS only) Subsequent open operations on the file will succeed only if it is being deleted.</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method succeeded.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_INVALIDARG</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Read/write access has been requested using file sharing.

OR

Read access has been requested without indicating read-and-delete file sharing.

OR

The access mode requested is not available with this method.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



The parameters <i>dwDesiredAccess</i> and <i>dwShareMode</i> are identical to those used in the <b>OpenFile</b> function defined in the Platform SDK. In the case of <b>OpenEx</b>, however, only a limited set of values are valid for <i>dwDesiredAccess</i>. Using any value other than those specified will result in an error.
