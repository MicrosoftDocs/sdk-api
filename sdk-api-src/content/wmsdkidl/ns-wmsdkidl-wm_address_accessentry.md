# WM_ADDRESS_ACCESSENTRY structure


## -description

The <b>WM_ADDRESS_ACCESSENTRY </b>structure specifies an entry in an IP address access list.

## -struct-fields

### -field dwIPAddress

An IPv4 address, in network byte order.

### -field dwMask

An IPv4 address, in network byte order, to use as a bitmask. The bitmask defines which bits in the <b>dwIPAddress</b> field are matched against. For example, if the IP address is 206.73.118.1 and the mask is 255.255.255.0, only the first 24 bits of the address are examined. Thus, any IP addresses in the range 206.73.118.<i>XXX</i> would match this entry.

## -remarks

You can use the <b>inet_addr</b> function to convert a standard dotted-format string (such as "255.255.255.255") to the correct binary number in network byte order.
