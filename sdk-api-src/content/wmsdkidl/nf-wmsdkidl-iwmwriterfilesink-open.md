## -remarks



There is no close method in this interface as the closing of the writer sink file is done automatically by a call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmwriter-endwriting">IWMWriter::EndWriting</a>.

See the Remarks and Example Code sections for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmwriter-beginwriting">IWMWriter::BeginWriting</a>.
