# IWMWriterSink::OnHeader


## -description



The <b>OnHeader</b> method is called by the writer when the ASF header is ready for the sink.




## -parameters




### -param pHeader [in]

Pointer to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wmsbuffer/nn-wmsbuffer-inssbuffer">INSSBuffer</a> interface on an object containing the ASF header.


## -returns



This method is implemented by the application. It should always return S_OK.




## -remarks



The ASF header will always be sent before any data units, as the header is required for reading the content. The writer may send the header more than once for a given file. If possible, your sink should write any headers received.
