# IWMSyncReader interface


## -description

The <b>IWMSyncReader</b> interface provides the ability to read ASF files using synchronous calls. This is in contrast to many of the methods in <b>IWMReader</b>, which are called asynchronously.

You get a pointer to an <b>IWMSyncReader</b> interface when you create a new synchronous reader object with a call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-wmcreatesyncreader">WMCreateSyncReader</a>.

In addition to enabling synchronous reading, the methods of <b>IWMSyncReader</b> are tailored to meet the demands of editing applications. Default playback from <b>IWMSyncReader</b> delivers uncompressed samples for the default streams of all outputs. However, you can manipulate the selected streams during streaming without having to enable manual stream selection. You can also receive compressed or uncompressed samples, though you cannot change between them during streaming. Samples are delivered by either output number or stream number, so you can receive uncompressed samples from mutually exclusive streams.

Many of the methods in this interface are almost identical to corresponding methods in the asynchronous reader.

Use of this interface, as well as the implementation of an <b>IStream</b> COM object that passes data to this object, is demonstrated in the WMSyncReader SDK sample.

## -inheritance

The <b>IWMSyncReader</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IWMSyncReader</b> also has these types of members:
