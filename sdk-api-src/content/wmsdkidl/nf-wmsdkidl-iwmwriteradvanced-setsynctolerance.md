# IWMWriterAdvanced::SetSyncTolerance


## -description



The <b>SetSyncTolerance</b> method sets the amount of time that the inputs can fall out of synchronization before the samples are discarded.




## -parameters




### -param msWindow [in]

Amount of time that the inputs can be out of synchronization, in milliseconds. Note that this parameter is in milliseconds and not 100-nanosecond units.


## -returns



This method always returns S_OK.




## -remarks



The default tolerance value is 3000 milliseconds.

Regardless of what the tolerance is set to, keeping samples as tightly synchronized as possible results in the best performance and the highest-quality content.
