## -remarks



You should make two calls to <b>GetHostURL</b>. On the first call, pass <b>NULL</b> as <i>pwszURL</i>. On return, the value pointed to by <i>pcchURL</i> is set to the number of characters, including the terminating <b>null</b> character, required to hold the URL. Then you can allocate the required amount of memory for the string and pass a pointer to it as <i>pwszURL</i> on the second call.
