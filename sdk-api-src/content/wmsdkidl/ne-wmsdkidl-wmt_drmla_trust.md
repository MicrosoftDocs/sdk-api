# WMT_DRMLA_TRUST enumeration


## -description

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Format 11 SDK](/windows/win32/wmformat/windows-media-format-11-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Source Reader](/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader) and [Sink Writer](/windows/win32/medfound/sink-writer). **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** instead of **Windows Media Format 11 SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Defines the trust state of a DRM license acquisition URL.

## -enum-fields

### -field WMT_DRMLA_UNTRUSTED:0

Indicates that the validity of the license acquisition URL cannot be guaranteed because it is not signed. All protected content created prior to Windows Media 9 Series will cause this value to be returned.

### -field WMT_DRMLA_TRUSTED

Indicates that the license acquisition URL is the original one provided with the content.

### -field WMT_DRMLA_TAMPERED

Indicates that the license acquisition URL was originally signed and has been tampered with.

## -remarks

When a <b>WMT_LICENSEURL_SIGNATURE_STATE</b> message is received in the <b>OnStatus</b> callback method, pValue will be set to one of the <b>WMT_DRMLA_TRUST</b> constants, which indicate whether there is any problem with the digital signature applied to the license acquisition URL.
