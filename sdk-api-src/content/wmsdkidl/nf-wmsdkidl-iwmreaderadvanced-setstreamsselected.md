# IWMReaderAdvanced::SetStreamsSelected


## -description



The <b>SetStreamsSelected</b> method specifies which streams are selected when manual stream selection is enabled.




## -parameters




### -param cStreamCount [in]

<b>WORD</b> containing the count of stream numbers in the <i>pwStreamNumbers</i> array.


### -param pwStreamNumbers [in]

Pointer to an array containing the stream numbers. Stream numbers are in the range of 1 through 63.


### -param pSelections [in]

Pointer to an array, of equal length to <i>pwStreamNumbers</i>, with each entry containing one member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/ne-wmsdkidl-wmt_stream_selection">WMT_STREAM_SELECTION</a> enumeration type.


## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

<dt><b>E_UNEXPECTED</b></dt>

</table>
 




## -remarks



This method enables the selected state of multiple streams to be changed simultaneously. Multiple streams can then be turned on or off at the exact time required. For this reason, the parameters of this method and the <b>GetStreamSelected</b> method are not identical.

When selecting streams manually, you should select only one stream at a time from each set of mutually exclusive streams in a file. The SDK does not prevent you from selecting multiple mutually exclusive streams, but the samples for all mutually exclusive streams will be delivered to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmreadercallback-onsample">IWMReaderCallback::OnSample</a> using the same output number. This makes it difficult to differentiate between samples from the various streams.

To deliver samples by stream number, you must receive uncompressed stream samples. You can receive stream samples for a specific stream by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmreaderadvanced-setreceivestreamsamples">IWMReaderAdvanced::SetReceiveStreamSamples</a>. You must also implement <b>IWMReaderCallbackAdvanced::OnStreamSample</b>.
