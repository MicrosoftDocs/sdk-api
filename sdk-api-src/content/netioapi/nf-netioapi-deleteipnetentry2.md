# DeleteIpNetEntry2 function


## -description


The 
<b>DeleteIpNetEntry2</b> function  deletes a neighbor IP address entry on the local computer. 


## -parameters




### -param Row [in]

A pointer to a 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/netioapi/ns-netioapi-mib_ipnet_row2">MIB_IPNET_ROW2</a> structure entry for a neighbor IP address entry. On successful return, this entry will be deleted.


## -returns



If the function succeeds, the return value is NO_ERROR.

If the function fails, the return value is one of the following error codes.

Access is denied. This error is returned under several conditions that include the following: the  user lacks the required administrative privileges on the local computer or the application is not running in an enhanced shell as the built-in Administrator (RunAs administrator).

## -remarks



The <b>DeleteIpNetEntry2</b> function is defined on Windows Vista and later. 

The <b>DeleteIpNetEntry2</b> function is used to delete a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/netioapi/ns-netioapi-mib_ipnet_row2">MIB_IPNET_ROW2</a> structure entry.  

On input, the <b>Address</b> member in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/netioapi/ns-netioapi-mib_ipnet_row2">MIB_IPNET_ROW2</a> structure pointed to by the <i>Row</i> parameter must be initialized to a valid neighbor IPv4 or IPv6 address and family. In addition, at least one of the following members in the <b>MIB_IPNET_ROW2</b> structure pointed to the <i>Row</i> parameter must be initialized:
    the <b>InterfaceLuid</b> or <b>InterfaceIndex</b>.

    The fields are used in the order listed above. So if the <b>InterfaceLuid</b> is specified, then this member is used to determine the interface. If no value was set for the  <b>InterfaceLuid</b> member (the values of this member was set to zero), then the <b>InterfaceIndex</b> member is next used to determine the interface. 

On output when the call is successful, <b>DeleteIpNetEntry2</b> deletes the neighbor IP address. 

The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/netioapi/nf-netioapi-getipnettable2">GetIpNetTable2</a> function can be called to enumerate the neighbor IP address entries on a local computer.

The <b>DeleteIpNetEntry2</b> function can only be called by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group. If <b>DeleteIpNetEntry2</b> is called by a user that is not a member of the Administrators group, the function call will fail and <b>ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED</b> is returned. This function can also fail because of user account control (UAC) on Windows Vista and later. If an application that contains this function is executed by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator, this call will fail unless the application has been marked in the manifest file with a <b>requestedExecutionLevel</b> set to requireAdministrator. If the application lacks this manifest file, a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator must then be executing the application in an enhanced shell as the built-in Administrator (RunAs administrator) for this function to succeed.
