# SetIpNetEntry2 function


## -description

The 
<b>SetIpNetEntry2</b> function  sets the physical address of an existing neighbor IP address entry on the local computer.

## -parameters

### -param Row [in, out]

A pointer to a 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/netioapi/ns-netioapi-mib_ipnet_row2">MIB_IPNET_ROW2</a> structure entry for a neighbor IP address entry.

## -returns

If the function succeeds, the return value is NO_ERROR.

If the function fails, the return value is one of the following error codes.

## -remarks

The <b>SetIpNetEntry2</b> function is defined on Windows Vista and later. 

The <b>SetIpNetEntry2</b> function is used to set the physical address for an existing neighbor IP address entry on a local computer. 

The <b>Address</b> member in the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/netioapi/ns-netioapi-mib_ipnet_row2">MIB_IPNET_ROW2</a> structure pointed to by the <i>Row</i> parameter must be initialized to a valid unicast, anycast, or multicast IPv4 or IPv6 address and family. The  <b>PhysicalAddress</b> and <b>PhysicalAddressLength</b> members in the <b>MIB_IPNET_ROW2</b> structure pointed to by the <i>Row</i> parameter must be initialized to a valid physical address. In addition, at least one of the following members in the <b>MIB_IPNET_ROW2</b> structure pointed to the <i>Row</i> parameter must be initialized to the interface: the <b>InterfaceLuid</b> or <b>InterfaceIndex</b>.

The fields are used in the order listed above. So if the <b>InterfaceLuid</b> is specified, then this member is used to determine the interface on which to add the unicast IP address. If no value was set for the  <b>InterfaceLuid</b> member (the values of this member was set to zero), then the <b>InterfaceIndex</b> member is next used to determine the interface. 

The <b>SetIpNetEntry2</b> function will fail if the IP address passed in the <b>Address</b> member of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/netioapi/ns-netioapi-mib_ipnet_row2">MIB_IPNET_ROW2</a> pointed to by the <i>Row</i> parameter is not an existing neighbor IP address on the interface specified. 

The <b>SetIpNetEntry2</b> function can only be called by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group. If <b>SetIpNetEntry2</b> is called by a user that is not a member of the Administrators group, the function call will fail and <b>ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED</b> is returned. 

The <b>SetIpNetEntry2</b> function can also fail because of user account control (UAC) on Windows Vista and later. If an application that contains this function is executed by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator, this call will fail unless the application has been marked in the manifest file with a <b>requestedExecutionLevel</b> set to requireAdministrator. If the application lacks this manifest file, a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator must then be executing the application in an enhanced shell as the built-in Administrator (RunAs administrator) for this function to succeed.
