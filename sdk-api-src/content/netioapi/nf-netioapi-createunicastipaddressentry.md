## -remarks



The <b>CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry</b> function is defined on Windows Vista and later. 

The <b>CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry</b> function is used to add a new unicast IP address entry on a local computer. The unicast IP address added by 
the <b>CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry</b> function is not persistent. The IP address exists only as long as the adapter object exists. Restarting the computer destroys the IP address, as does manually resetting the network interface card (NIC). Also, certain PnP events may destroy the address.

To create an IPv4 address that persists, the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/CIMWin32Prov/enablestatic-method-in-class-win32-networkadapterconfiguration">EnableStatic method of the Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration Class</a> in the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) controls may be used. The netsh command can also be used to create a persistent IPv4 or IPv6 address. 

For more information, please see the documentation on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinSock/netsh-exe">Netsh.exe</a> in the Windows Sockets documentation.

The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/netioapi/nf-netioapi-initializeunicastipaddressentry">InitializeUnicastIpAddressEntry</a> function should be used to initialize the members of a
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/netioapi/ns-netioapi-mib_unicastipaddress_row">MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW</a> structure entry with default values.  An application can then change the
    members in the <b>MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW</b> entry it wishes to modify, and then call the <b>CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry</b> function.

The <b>Address</b> member in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/netioapi/ns-netioapi-mib_unicastipaddress_row">MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW</a> structure pointed to by the <i>Row</i> parameter must be initialized to a valid unicast IPv4 or IPv6 address. The <b>si_family</b> member of the <b>SOCKADDR_INET</b> structure  in the  <b>Address</b> member must be initialized to either <b>AF_INET</b> or <b>AF_INET6</b> and the related <b>Ipv4</b> or <b>Ipv6</b> member of the  <b>SOCKADDR_INET</b> structure must be set to a valid unicast IP address. In addition, at least one of the following members in the <b>MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW</b> structure pointed to the <i>Row</i> parameter must be initialized to the interface: the <b>InterfaceLuid</b> or <b>InterfaceIndex</b>.

    The fields are used in the order listed above. So if the <b>InterfaceLuid</b> is specified, then this member is used to determine the interface on which to add the unicast IP address. If no value was set for the  <b>InterfaceLuid</b> member (the values of this member was set to zero), then the <b>InterfaceIndex</b> member is next used to determine the interface. 

If the <b>OnLinkPrefixLength</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/netioapi/ns-netioapi-mib_unicastipaddress_row">MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW</a> pointed to by the <i>Row</i> parameter is set to 255, then <b>CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry</b> will add the new unicast IP address with the  <b>OnLinkPrefixLength</b> member set equal to the length of the IP address. So for a unicast IPv4 address, the  <b>OnLinkPrefixLength</b> is set to 32 and the <b>OnLinkPrefixLength</b> is set to 128 for a unicast IPv6 address. If this would result in the incorrect subnet mask for an IPv4 address or the incorrect link prefix for an IPv6 address, then the application should set this member to the correct value before calling <b>CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry</b>. 

If a unicast IP address is created with the <b>OnLinkPrefixLength</b> member set incorrectly, then the IP address may be changed by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/netioapi/nf-netioapi-setunicastipaddressentry">SetUnicastIpAddressEntry</a> with the  <b>OnLinkPrefixLength</b> member set to the correct value.

The <b>DadState</b>, <b>ScopeId</b>, and <b>CreationTimeStamp</b> members of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/netioapi/ns-netioapi-mib_unicastipaddress_row">MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW</a> structure pointed to by the <i>Row</i> are ignored when the  <b>CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry</b> function is called. These members are set by the network stack. The  <b>ScopeId</b> member is automatically determined by the interface on which the address is added. Beginning in Windows 10, if <b>DadState</b> is set to <b>IpDadStatePreferred</b> in the <b>MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW</b> structure when calling <b>CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry</b>, the stack will set the initial DAD state of the address to “preferred” instead of “tentative” and will do optimistic DAD for the address.

The <b>CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry</b> function will fail if the unicast IP address passed in the <b>Address</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/netioapi/ns-netioapi-mib_unicastipaddress_row">MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW</a> pointed to by the <i>Row</i> parameter is a duplicate of an existing unicast IP address on the interface. Note that a loopback IP address can only be added to a loopback interface using the <b>CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry</b> function. 

The unicast IP address passed in the <b>Address</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/netioapi/ns-netioapi-mib_unicastipaddress_row">MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW</a> pointed to by the <i>Row</i> parameter is not usable immediately. The IP address is usable after the duplicate address detection process has completed successfully. It can take several seconds for the duplicate address detection process to complete since IP packets need to  be sent and potential responses must be awaited. For IPv6, the duplicate address detection process typically takes about a second. For IPv4, the duplicate address detection process typically takes about three seconds. 

If an application that needs to know when an IP address is usable after a call to  the <b>CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry</b> function, there are two methods that can be used. One method uses polling and the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/netioapi/nf-netioapi-getunicastipaddressentry">GetUnicastIpAddressEntry</a> function. The second method calls one of the notification functions, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/iphlpapi/nf-iphlpapi-notifyaddrchange">NotifyAddrChange</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/netioapi/nf-netioapi-notifyipinterfacechange">NotifyIpInterfaceChange</a>, or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/netioapi/nf-netioapi-notifyunicastipaddresschange">NotifyUnicastIpAddressChange</a> to set up an asynchronous notification for when an address changes.

The following method describes how to use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/netioapi/nf-netioapi-getunicastipaddressentry">GetUnicastIpAddressEntry</a> and polling. After the call to the <b>CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry</b> function returns successfully, pause for one to three seconds (depending on whether an IPv6 or IPv4 address is being created) to allow time for the successful completion of the duplication address detection process. Then call the <b>GetUnicastIpAddressEntry</b> function to retrieve the updated <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/netioapi/ns-netioapi-mib_unicastipaddress_row">MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW</a> structure and examine the value of the <b>DadState</b> member. If the value of the <b>DadState</b> member is set to <b>IpDadStatePreferred</b>, the IP address is now usable.  If the value of the <b>DadState</b> member is set to <b>IpDadStateTentative</b>, then duplicate address detection has not yet completed. In this case, call the <b>GetUnicastIpAddressEntry</b> function again every half a second while the <b>DadState</b> member is still set to <b>IpDadStateTentative</b>. If the value of the <b>DadState</b> member returns with some value other than <b>IpDadStatePreferred</b> or <b>IpDadStateTentative</b>, duplicate address detection has failed and the IP address is not usable.  

The following method describes how to use an appropriate notification function. After the call to the <b>CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry</b> function returns successfully, call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/netioapi/nf-netioapi-notifyunicastipaddresschange">NotifyUnicastIpAddressChange</a> function to register to be notified of changes to either IPv6 or IPv4 unicast IP addresses, depending on the type of IP address being created. When a notification is received for the IP address being created, call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/netioapi/nf-netioapi-getunicastipaddressentry">GetUnicastIpAddressEntry</a> function to retrieve the <b>DadState</b> member.  If the value of the <b>DadState</b> member is set to <b>IpDadStatePreferred</b>, the IP address is now usable.  If the value of the <b>DadState</b> member is set to <b>IpDadStateTentative</b>, then duplicate address detection has not yet completed and the application needs to wait for future notifications. If the value of the <b>DadState</b> member returns with some value other than <b>IpDadStatePreferred</b> or <b>IpDadStateTentative</b>, duplicate address detection has failed and the IP address is not usable.  

If during the duplicate address detection process the media is disconnected and then reconnected, the duplicate address detection process is restarted. So it is possible for the time to complete the process to increase beyond the typical 1 second value for IPv6 or 3 second value for IPv4.

The <b>CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry</b> function can only be called by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group. If <b>CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry</b> is called by a user that is not a member of the Administrators group, the function call will fail and ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED is returned. This function can also fail because of user account control (UAC) on Windows Vista and later. If an application that contains this function is executed by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator, this call will fail unless the application has been marked in the manifest file with a <b>requestedExecutionLevel</b> set to requireAdministrator. If the application on lacks this manifest file, a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator must then be executing the application in an enhanced shell as the built-in Administrator (RunAs administrator) for this function to succeed.
