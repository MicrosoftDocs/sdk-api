# CLS_INFORMATION structure


## -description


Describes general information about a log. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/clfsw32/nf-clfsw32-getlogfileinformation">GetLogFileInformation</a> function returns the <b>CLFS_INFORMATION</b> structure.


## -struct-fields




### -field TotalAvailable

The total available space that is allocated to a log, in bytes.  

This member is the sum of the sizes of all containers that are allocated to the dedicated log.


### -field CurrentAvailable

The space that is available in a log to  append new records and reservation allocations, in bytes.  


### -field TotalReservation

The total space in a  log that is dedicated to reservation allocations.


### -field BaseFileSize

The size of the base log, in bytes.


### -field ContainerSize

The size of a container, in bytes.


### -field TotalContainers

The number of active containers that are associated with a dedicated log.


### -field FreeContainers

The number of containers that are not in an active log.


### -field TotalClients

The number of  log streams  that are active in a physical log.


### -field Attributes

The log  attributes that are set by using the <i>fFlagsAndAttributes</i> parameter of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/clfsw32/nf-clfsw32-createlogfile">CreateLogFile</a> when a log is created.


### -field FlushThreshold

The number of bytes of data that can remain pending on the internal flush queue before  the Common Log File System (CLFS)  automatically writes the data to disk. 


### -field SectorSize

The sector size of the underlying disk geometry, in bytes.  

The sector size is assumed to be a multiple of 512 and consistent across log containers.


### -field MinArchiveTailLsn

The log sequence number (LSN) of the log archive tail.


### -field BaseLsn

The LSN that marks the start of the active region of a log.


### -field LastFlushedLsn

The value of <b>LastFlushedLsn</b> indicates that any LSNs smaller than the one specified are already  flushed to disk.


### -field LastLsn

The value of <b>LastLsn</b> indicates that any LSNs smaller than the one specified are already  appended to the log.


### -field RestartLsn

The LSN of the last written restart record.  

If the log  does not have a  restart area, the LSN has the value of CLFS_LSN_INVALID.


### -field Identity

The unique identifier for a log.
