## -remarks

This method is asynchronous. If the method returns a success code, the caller will receive an <b>MF_CAPTURE_ENGINE_PREVIEW_STOPPED</b> event through the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mfcaptureengine/nf-mfcaptureengine-imfcaptureengineoneventcallback-onevent">IMFCaptureEngineOnEventCallback::OnEvent</a> method. The operation can fail asynchronously after the method succeeds. If so, the error code is conveyed through the <b>OnEvent</b> method.
