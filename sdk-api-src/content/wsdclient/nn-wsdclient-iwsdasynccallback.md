# IWSDAsyncCallback interface


## -description

Handles callbacks for the completion of an asynchronous operation.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IWSDAsyncCallback</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IWSDAsyncCallback</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

This interface provides an asynchronous calling pattern in support of WSDAPI messaging and eventing, allowing an application to receive callback notification based on the status of an operation.

The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wsdclient/nn-wsdclient-iwsdasyncresult">IWSDAsyncResult</a> interface can be used to wait for event notification or to poll for operation completion if asynchronous callbacks are not required.
