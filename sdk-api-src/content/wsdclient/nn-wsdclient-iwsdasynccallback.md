# IWSDAsyncCallback interface


## -description


Handles callbacks for the completion of an asynchronous operation.


## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IWSDAsyncCallback</b> interface inherits from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IWSDAsyncCallback</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -members

The <b>IWSDAsyncCallback</b> interface has these methods.
<table class="members" id="memberListMethods">
<tr>
<th align="left" width="37%">Method</th>
<th align="left" width="63%">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr data="declared;">
<td align="left" width="37%">
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wsdclient/nf-wsdclient-iwsdasynccallback-asyncoperationcomplete">AsyncOperationComplete</a>
</td>
<td align="left" width="63%">
Indicates that the asynchronous operation has completed.

</td>
</tr>
</table> 


## -remarks



This interface provides an asynchronous calling pattern in support of WSDAPI messaging and eventing, allowing an application to receive callback notification based on the status of an operation.

The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wsdclient/nn-wsdclient-iwsdasyncresult">IWSDAsyncResult</a> interface can be used to wait for event notification or to poll for operation completion if asynchronous callbacks are not required.
