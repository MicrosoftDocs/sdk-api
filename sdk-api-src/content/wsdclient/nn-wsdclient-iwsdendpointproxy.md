# IWSDEndpointProxy interface


## -description

Implements a device services messaging proxy.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IWSDEndpointProxy</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IWSDEndpointProxy</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

Service proxy objects may reside on multiple endpoints. An endpoint more completely represents a URL (contains additional useful data). One endpoint may support HTTP on IPv4 addresses and another may support HTTPS on IPv6 addresses. Since the same service lives on both endpoints, it is important that the service have underlying endpoint proxy objects, with each endpoint proxy corresponding to a single endpoint at which the service is available. The endpoint proxy takes care of simple messaging requests to the service, for example, sending one-way or two-way messages.

Endpoint proxies are generally used inside WSDAPI, but they can be retrieved from <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wsdclient/nn-wsdclient-iwsdserviceproxy">IWSDServiceProxy</a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wsdclient/nn-wsdclient-iwsddeviceproxy">IWSDDeviceProxy</a> objects to expose message-level functionality.
