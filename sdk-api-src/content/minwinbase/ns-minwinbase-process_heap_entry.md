# PROCESS_HEAP_ENTRY structure


## -description


Contains information about a heap element. The 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heapwalk">HeapWalk</a> function uses a 
    <b>PROCESS_HEAP_ENTRY</b> structure to enumerate the 
    elements of a heap.


## -struct-fields




### -field lpData

A pointer to the data portion of the heap element.

To initiate a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heapwalk">HeapWalk</a> heap enumeration, set 
       <b>lpData</b> to <b>NULL</b>.

If <b>PROCESS_HEAP_REGION</b> is used in the <b>wFlags</b> member, 
       <b>lpData</b> points to the first virtual address used by the region.

If <b>PROCESS_HEAP_UNCOMMITTED_RANGE</b> is used in <b>wFlags</b>, 
       <b>lpData</b> points to the beginning of the range of uncommitted memory.


### -field cbData

The size of the data portion of the heap element, in bytes.

If <b>PROCESS_HEAP_REGION</b> is used in <b>wFlags</b>, 
       <b>cbData</b> specifies the total size, in bytes, of the address space that is reserved for 
       this region.

If <b>PROCESS_HEAP_UNCOMMITTED_RANGE</b> is used in <b>wFlags</b>, 
       <b>cbData</b> specifies the size, in bytes, of the range of uncommitted memory.


### -field cbOverhead

The size of the data used by the system to maintain information about the heap element, in bytes. These 
       overhead bytes are in addition to the <b>cbData</b> bytes of the data portion of the heap 
       element.

If <b>PROCESS_HEAP_REGION</b> is used in <b>wFlags</b>, 
       <b>cbOverhead</b> specifies the size, in bytes, of the heap control structures that 
       describe the region.

If <b>PROCESS_HEAP_UNCOMMITTED_RANGE</b> is used in <b>wFlags</b>, 
       <b>cbOverhead</b> specifies the size, in bytes, of the control structures that describe 
       this uncommitted range.


### -field iRegionIndex

A handle to the heap region that contains the heap element. A heap consists of one or more regions of virtual 
       memory, each with a unique region index.

In the first heap entry returned for most heap regions, 
       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heapwalk">HeapWalk</a> uses the 
       <b>PROCESS_HEAP_REGION</b> in the <b>wFlags</b> member. When this value 
       is used, the members of the <b>Region</b> structure contain additional information 
       about the region.

The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heapalloc">HeapAlloc</a> function sometimes uses the 
       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc">VirtualAlloc</a> function to allocate large blocks from a 
       growable heap. The heap manager treats such a large block allocation as a separate region with a unique region 
       index. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heapwalk">HeapWalk</a> does not use 
       <b>PROCESS_HEAP_REGION</b> in the heap entry returned for a large block region, so the 
       members of the <b>Region</b> structure are not valid. You can use the 
       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualquery">VirtualQuery</a> function to get additional information 
       about a large block region.


### -field wFlags

The properties of the heap element. Some values affect the meaning of other members of this 
       <b>PROCESS_HEAP_ENTRY</b> data structure. The 
       following values are defined.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>

</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The heap element is an allocated block.

If <b>PROCESS_HEAP_ENTRY_MOVEABLE</b> is also specified, the 
         <b>Block</b> structure becomes valid. The <b>hMem</b> member of 
         the <b>Block</b> structure contains a handle to the allocated, moveable memory 
         block.

<dt>0x0020</dt>
</dl>

<td width="60%">
This value must be used with <b>PROCESS_HEAP_ENTRY_BUSY</b>, indicating that the heap 
        element is an allocated block.

</td>
<td width="60%">
This value must be used with <b>PROCESS_HEAP_ENTRY_BUSY</b>, indicating that the heap 
         element is an allocated block.

The block was allocated with <b>LMEM_MOVEABLE</b> or 
         <b>GMEM_MOVEABLE</b>, and the <b>Block</b> structure becomes 
         valid. The <b>hMem</b> member of the <b>Block</b> structure 
         contains a handle to the allocated, moveable memory block.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="PROCESS_HEAP_REGION"></a><a id="process_heap_region"></a><dl>
<dt><b>PROCESS_HEAP_REGION</b></dt>
<dt>0x0001</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The heap element is located at the beginning of a region of contiguous virtual memory in use by the heap.

The <b>lpData</b> member of the structure points to the first virtual address used by 
         the region; the <b>cbData</b> member specifies the total size, in bytes, of the address 
         space that is reserved for this region; and the <b>cbOverhead</b> member specifies the 
         size, in bytes, of the heap control structures that describe the region.

The <b>Region</b> structure becomes valid. The 
         <b>dwCommittedSize</b>, <b>dwUnCommittedSize</b>, 
         <b>lpFirstBlock</b>, and <b>lpLastBlock</b> members of the structure 
         contain additional information about the region.

<dt><b>PROCESS_HEAP_UNCOMMITTED_RANGE</b></dt>
<dt>0x0002</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The heap element is located in a range of uncommitted memory within the heap region.

The <b>lpData</b> member points to the beginning of the range of uncommitted memory; 
         the <b>cbData</b> member specifies the size, in bytes, of the range of uncommitted 
         memory; and the <b>cbOverhead</b> member specifies the size, in bytes, of the control 
         structures that describe this uncommitted range.
