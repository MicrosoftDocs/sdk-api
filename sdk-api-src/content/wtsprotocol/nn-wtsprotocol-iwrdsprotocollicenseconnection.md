# IWRdsProtocolLicenseConnection interface


## -description

Exposes methods used by the Remote Desktop Services service to perform the licensing handshake during a connection sequence. This interface is implemented by the protocol, and its methods are called by the Remote Desktop Services service.

## -inheritance

The <b>IWRdsProtocolLicenseConnection</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IWRdsProtocolLicenseConnection</b> also has these types of members:

## -remarks

To avoid a possible deadlock when calling any of the methods on this interface, you should not make any function or method calls that will directly or indirectly result in a Remote Desktop Services API being called. If you need to make any outbound call, you should start a new thread and make the outbound call from the new thread.
