# ID3D11DeviceContext::DrawInstanced


## -description


Draw non-indexed, instanced primitives.


## -parameters




### -param VertexCountPerInstance [in]

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT</a></b>

Number of vertices to draw.


### -param InstanceCount [in]

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT</a></b>

Number of instances to draw.


### -param StartVertexLocation [in]

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT</a></b>

Index of the first vertex.


### -param StartInstanceLocation [in]

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT</a></b>

A value added to each index before reading per-instance data from a vertex buffer.


## -remarks



A draw API submits work to the rendering pipeline.

Instancing may extend performance by reusing the same geometry to draw multiple objects in a scene. One example of instancing could be 
      to draw the same object with different positions and colors.

The vertex data for an instanced draw call normally comes from a vertex buffer that is bound to the pipeline. 
      However, you could also provide the vertex data from a shader that has instanced data identified with a system-value semantic (SV_InstanceID).
