# ID3D11Device::CreateSamplerState


## -description

Create a sampler-state object that encapsulates sampling information for a texture.

## -parameters

### -param pSamplerDesc [in]

Type: <b>const <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d11/ns-d3d11-d3d11_sampler_desc">D3D11_SAMPLER_DESC</a>*</b>

Pointer to a sampler state description (see <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d11/ns-d3d11-d3d11_sampler_desc">D3D11_SAMPLER_DESC</a>).

### -param ppSamplerState [out, optional]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d11/nn-d3d11-id3d11samplerstate">ID3D11SamplerState</a>**</b>

Address of a pointer to the sampler state object created (see <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d11/nn-d3d11-id3d11samplerstate">ID3D11SamplerState</a>).

## -returns

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/com/structure-of-com-error-codes">HRESULT</a></b>

This method returns one of the following <a href="/windows/desktop/direct3d11/d3d11-graphics-reference-returnvalues">Direct3D 11 Return Codes</a>.

## -remarks

4096 unique sampler state objects can be created on a device at a time.

If an application attempts to create a sampler-state interface with the same state as an existing interface, the same interface will be returned and the total number of unique sampler state objects will stay the same.
