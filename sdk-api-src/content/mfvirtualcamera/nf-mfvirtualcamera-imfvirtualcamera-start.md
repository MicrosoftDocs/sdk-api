## -description

Creates and registers the virtual camera.

## -parameters

### -param pCallback

Optional pointer to an [IMFAsyncCallback](../mfobjects/nn-mfobjects-imfasynccallback.md) object that the pipeline will use to notify the caller of the state of the virtual camera. The callback, if provided, may be invoked with a [IMFMediaEvent](../mfobjects/nn-mfobjects-imfmediaevent.md).  When invoked, the [IMFMediaEvent::GetType](../mfobjects/nf-mfobjects-imfmediaevent-gettype.md) method will return an [MEExtendedType](/windows/win32/medfound/meextendedtype) or an [MEError](/windows/win32/medfound/meerror).  If an **MEExtendedType** is returned, the [IMFMediaEvent::GetExtendedType](../mfobjects/nf-mfobjects-imfmediaevent-getextendedtype.md) method may return one of the following event types:

| Extended event type | Description |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| MF_FRAMESERVER_VCAMEVENT_EXTENDED_SOURCE_INITIALIZE | The custom media source representing the virtual camera was initialized by an application. | 
| MF_FRAMESERVER_VCAMEVENT_EXTENDED_SOURCE_START | A stream (or streams) on the virtual camera’s custom media source was started by an application. |
| MF_FRAMESERVER_VCAMEVENT_EXTENDED_SOURCE_STOP | All streams on the virtual camera’s custom media source were stopped by the application. |
| MF_FRAMESERVER_VCAMEVENT_EXTENDED_SOURCE_UNINITIALIZE | The virtual camera’s custom media source was uninitialized. |
| MF_FRAMESERVER_VCAMEVENT_EXTENDED_PIPELINE_SHUTDOWN | The virtual camera’s pipeline was shutdown. |
| MF_FRAMESERVER_VCAMEVENT_EXTENDED_CUSTOM_EVENT | A custom event was generated by the virtual camera’s custom media source.  The schema for the **IMFMediaEvent** is vendor specific. |

The callback may be called at any time after the **IMFVirtualCamera::Start** has successfully returned.  

## -returns

Returns an HRESULT value, including but not limited to the following values:

| Error code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| S_OK    | Succeeded |
| E_INVALIDARG | An input parameter is invalid. |

## -remarks

Until a successful call to the **Start** method has been made, the [IMFVirtualCamera](nn-mfvirtualcamera-imfvirtualcamera.md) represents the virtual camera configuration information and the underlying virtual camera does not yet exist - unless the [MFCreateVirtualCamera](nf-mfvirtualcamera-mfcreatevirtualcamera.md) is re-opening an existing virtual camera.
Once **Start** has been called successfully, the [IMFAttributes](../mfobjects/nn-mfobjects-imfattributes.md) that **IMFVirtualCamera** inherits from will contain the newly created virtual camera’s symbolic link name,  [MF_DEVSOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_SOURCE_TYPE_VIDCAP_SYMBOLIC_LINK](/windows/win32/medfound/mf-devsource-attribute-source-type-vidcap-symbolic-link).  

If **MFCreateVirtualCamera** is called with the same parameters as a prior call, specifying a **IMFVirtualCamera** that was already started with a successful call to **IMFVirtualCamera::Start**, the result **IMFVirtualCamera** is already in a valid state and subsequent calls to **IMFVirtualCamera::Start** may be used to register new callbacks.
