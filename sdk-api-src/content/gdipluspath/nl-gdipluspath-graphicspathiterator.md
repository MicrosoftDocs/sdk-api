## -description


This <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3186bc85-03c2-432b-b8de-b464738ffa6a">GraphicsPathIterator</a> class provides methods for isolating selected subsets of the path stored in a 
			<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/933dd879-480c-4b8a-965a-1656382d849a">GraphicsPath</a> object. A path consists of one or more figures. You can use a <b>GraphicsPathIterator</b> to isolate one or more of those figures. A path can also have markers that divide the path into sections. You can use a <b>GraphicsPathIterator</b> object to isolate one or more of those sections.
