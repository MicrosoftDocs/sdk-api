# VIDEOPARAMETERS structure


## -description


The video miniport driver receives a pointer to a VIDEOPARAMETERS structure in the <b>InputBuffer</b> member of a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/video/ns-video-_video_request_packet">VIDEO_REQUEST_PACKET</a> when the IOCTL request is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddvdeo/ni-ntddvdeo-ioctl_video_handle_videoparameters">IOCTL_VIDEO_HANDLE_VIDEOPARAMETERS</a>. Depending on the <b>dwCommand</b> member of the VIDEOPARAMETERS structure, the miniport driver should get or set the television connector and copy protection capabilities of the device.


## -struct-fields




### -field Guid

Specifies the globally unique identifier (GUID) for this structure {02C62061-1097-11d1-920F-00A024DF156E}. A video miniport driver must verify the GUID at the start of the structure before processing the structure.


### -field dwOffset

Is reserved and should be ignored by the video miniport driver.


### -field dwCommand

Indicates the action to be performed by the driver. This member can be one of the following values:





#### VP_COMMAND_GET

The miniport driver should return all of the device's TV connector capabilities, current TV connector settings, copy protection capabilities, and current copy protection settings by setting the appropriate flags in <b>dwFlags</b> and setting the values of the members that correspond to those set flags.



#### VP_COMMAND_SET

The miniport driver should set the TV connector and copy protection hardware according to the members of this structure that correspond to the flags set in <b>dwFlags</b>.


### -field dwFlags

Indicates which members of this structure contain valid data. When <b>dwCommand</b> is VP_COMMAND_GET, the driver should set the appropriate bits in this member to indicate in which corresponding members it has returned valid data. When <b>dwCommand</b> is VP_COMMAND_SET, the driver should set the functionality on the hardware according to values in the members that correspond with the bits set in this member. This member can be a bitwise OR of the values listed in the first column of the following table.
