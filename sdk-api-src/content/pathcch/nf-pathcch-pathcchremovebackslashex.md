# PathCchRemoveBackslashEx function


## -description

Removes the trailing backslash from the end of a path string.

This function differs from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/pathcch/nf-pathcch-pathcchremovebackslash">PathCchRemoveBackslash</a> in that it can return a pointer to the new end of the string and report the number of unused characters remaining in the buffer.

This function differs from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shlwapi/nf-shlwapi-pathremovebackslasha">PathRemoveBackslash</a> in that it accepts paths with "\\", "\\?\" and "\\?\UNC\" prefixes.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This function, or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/pathcch/nf-pathcch-pathcchremovebackslash">PathCchRemoveBackslash</a>, should be used in place of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shlwapi/nf-shlwapi-pathremovebackslasha">PathRemoveBackslash</a> to prevent the possibility of a buffer overrun.</div>


## -parameters


### -param pszPath [in, out]

A pointer to the path string. When this function returns successfully, the string contains the path with any trailing backslash removed. If no trailing backslash was found, the string is unchanged.


### -param cchPath [in]

The size of the buffer pointed to by <i>pszPath</i>, in characters.


### -param ppszEnd [out, optional]

A value that, when this function returns successfully, receives the address of a pointer to end of the new string. If the string is a root path such as "C:\", the pointer points to the backslash; otherwise the pointer points to the string's terminating null character.


### -param pcchRemaining [out, optional]

A pointer to a value that, when this function returns successfully, receives the number of unused characters in the destination buffer, including the terminating null character. If the string is a root path such as "C:\", this count includes the backslash in that string.


## -returns

This function returns <b>S_OK</b> if the function was successful, <b>S_FALSE</b> if the string was a root path or if no backslash was found, or an error code otherwise.


## -remarks

This function will not remove the backslash from a root path string, such as "C:\".
