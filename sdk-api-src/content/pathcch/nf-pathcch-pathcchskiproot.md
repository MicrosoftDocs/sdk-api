# PathCchSkipRoot function


## -description



Retrieves a pointer to the first character in a path following the drive letter or Universal Naming Convention (UNC) server/share path elements.

This function differs from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shlwapi/nf-shlwapi-pathskiproota">PathSkipRoot</a> in that it accepts paths with "\\", "\\?\" and "\\?\UNC\" prefixes.




## -parameters




### -param pszPath [in]

A pointer to the path string.


### -param ppszRootEnd [out]

The address of a pointer that, when this function returns successfully, points to the first character in a path following the drive letter or UNC server/share path elements. If the path consists of only a root, this value will point to the string's terminating null character.


## -returns



If this function succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.
