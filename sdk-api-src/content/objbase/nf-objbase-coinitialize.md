# CoInitialize function


## -description

Initializes the COM library on the current thread and identifies the concurrency model as single-thread apartment (STA).

New applications should call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coinitializeex">CoInitializeEx</a> instead of CoInitialize. 

If you want to use the Windows Runtime, you must call <a href="/windows/win32/api/roapi/nf-roapi-roinitialize">RoInitialize</a> or <a href="/windows/win32/api/roapi/nf-roapi-initialize">Windows::Foundation::Initialize</a> instead.

## -parameters

### -param pvReserved [in, optional]

This parameter is reserved and must be <b>NULL</b>.

## -returns

This function can return the standard return values E_INVALIDARG, E_OUTOFMEMORY, and E_UNEXPECTED, as well as the following values.

A previous call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coinitializeex">CoInitializeEx</a> specified the concurrency model for this thread as multithread apartment (MTA). This could also indicate that a change from neutral-threaded apartment to single-threaded apartment has occurred.

## -remarks

You need to initialize the COM library on a thread before you call any of the library functions except <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cogetmalloc">CoGetMalloc</a>, to get a pointer to the standard allocator, and the memory allocation functions.



After the concurrency model for a thread is set, it cannot be changed. A call to <b>CoInitialize</b> on an apartment that was previously initialized as multithreaded will fail and return RPC_E_CHANGED_MODE. 




<a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coinitializeex">CoInitializeEx</a> provides the same functionality as <b>CoInitialize</b> and also provides a parameter to explicitly specify the thread's concurrency model. <b>CoInitialize</b> calls <b>CoInitializeEx</b> and specifies the concurrency model as single-thread apartment. Applications developed today should call <b>CoInitializeEx</b> rather than <b>CoInitialize</b>. 



Typically, the COM library is initialized on a thread only once. Subsequent calls to <b>CoInitialize</b> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coinitializeex">CoInitializeEx</a> on the same thread will succeed, as long as they do not attempt to change the concurrency model, but will return S_FALSE. To close the COM library gracefully, each successful call to <b>CoInitialize</b> or <b>CoInitializeEx</b>, including those that return S_FALSE, must be balanced by a corresponding call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-couninitialize">CoUninitialize</a>. However, the first thread in the application that calls <b>CoInitialize</b> with 0 (or <b>CoInitializeEx</b> with COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED) must be the last thread to call <b>CoUninitialize</b>. Otherwise, subsequent calls to <b>CoInitialize</b> on the STA will fail and the application will not work.

Because there is no way to control the order in which in-process servers are loaded or unloaded, do not call <b>CoInitialize</b>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coinitializeex">CoInitializeEx</a>, or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-couninitialize">CoUninitialize</a> from the <a href="/windows/desktop/Dlls/dllmain">DllMain</a> function.
