# SwDevicePropertySet function


## -description


Sets properties on a software device.  


## -parameters




### -param hSwDevice [in]

The <b>HSWDEVICE</b> handle to the software device to set properties for. 


### -param cPropertyCount [in]

The number of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/dn315030(v=vs.85)">DEVPROPERTY</a> structures in the <i>pProperties</i> array.


### -param pProperties [in]

An array of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/dn315030(v=vs.85)">DEVPROPERTY</a> structures containing the properties to set.


## -returns



S_OK is returned if <b>SwDevicePropertySet</b> successfully set the properties; otherwise, an appropriate error value. 




## -remarks



Typically, only the operating system and Administrators of the computer can set properties on a device, but the creator of a device can call <b>SwDevicePropertySet</b> to set properties on that device even if it isn't the operating system or an Administrator.

You can call <b>SwDevicePropertySet</b> only after the operating system has called your client app's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/swdevice/nc-swdevice-sw_device_create_callback">SW_DEVICE_CREATE_CALLBACK</a> callback function to notify the client app that device enumeration completed.

There is a subtle difference between properties that are set as part of a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/swdevice/nf-swdevice-swdevicecreate">SwDeviceCreate</a> call and properties that are later set by calling <b>SwDevicePropertySet</b>.  Properties that are set as part of <b>SwDeviceCreate</b> are stored in memory; if the device is uninstalled or a null driver wipes out the property stores, these properties are written out again by the Software Device API feature when PnP re-enumerates the devices.  This is all transparent to the client.  Properties that are set using <b>SwDevicePropertySet</b> after the enumeration don't persist in memory.  But, if you set a property by using <b>SwDeviceCreate</b>, you can update the value with <b>SwDevicePropertySet</b>, and this update is applied to the in-memory value as well as the persisted store.

You can use <b>SwDevicePropertySet</b> only to set properties in the operating system store for the device.
