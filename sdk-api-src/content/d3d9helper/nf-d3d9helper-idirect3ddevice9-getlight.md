# IDirect3DDevice9::GetLight


## -description


Retrieves a set of lighting properties that this device uses.


## -parameters




### -param Index [in]

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">DWORD</a></b>

Zero-based index of the lighting property set to retrieve. This method will fail if a lighting property has not been set for this index by calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-setlight">IDirect3DDevice9::SetLight</a> method. 


### -param arg2 [out]

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d9/d3dlight9">D3DLight9</a>*</b>

Pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d9/d3dlight9">D3DLIGHT9</a> structure that is filled with the retrieved lighting-parameter set. 


## -returns



Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/com/structure-of-com-error-codes">HRESULT</a></b>

If the method succeeds, the return value is D3D_OK. If the method fails, the return value can be D3DERR_INVALIDCALL.




## -remarks



This method will not return device state for a device that is created using D3DCREATE_PUREDEVICE. If you want to use this method, you must create your device with any of the other values in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d9/d3dcreate">D3DCREATE</a>.

Retrieve all the properties for an existing light source by calling the <b>IDirect3DDevice9::GetLight</b> method for the device. When calling the <b>IDirect3DDevice9::GetLight</b> method, pass the zero-based index of the light source for which the properties will be retrieved as the first parameter, and supply the address of a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d9/d3dlight9">D3DLIGHT9</a> structure as the second parameter. The device fills the <b>D3DLIGHT9</b> structure to describe the lighting properties it uses for the light source at that index.


```

// Assume d3dDevice is a valid pointer to an IDirect3DDevice9 interface.
HRESULT hr;
D3DLight9 light;
    
// Get the property information for the first light.
hr = pd3dDevice->GetLight(0, &light);
if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
    // Handle Success
else
    // Handle failure

```


If you supply an index outside the range of the light sources assigned in the device, the <b>IDirect3DDevice9::GetLight</b> method fails, returning D3DERR_INVALIDCALL.

When you assign a set of light properties for a light source in a scene, the light source can be activated by calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-lightenable">IDirect3DDevice9::LightEnable</a> method for the device. New light sources are disabled by default. The <b>IDirect3DDevice9::LightEnable</b> method accepts two parameters. Set the first parameter to the zero-based index of the light source to be affected by the method, and set the second parameter to <b>TRUE</b> to enable the light or <b>FALSE</b> to disable it. The following code example illustrates the use of this method by enabling the first light source in the device's list of light source properties.


```

// Assume d3dDevice is a valid pointer to an IDirect3DDevice9 interface.
HRESULT hr;
    
hr = pd3dDevice->LightEnable(0, TRUE);
if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
    // Handle Success
else
    // Handle failure

```


Check the MaxActiveLights member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9caps/ns-d3d9caps-d3dcaps9">D3DCAPS9</a> structure when you retrieve device capabilities to determine the maximum number of active lights supported by that device.

If you enable or disable a light that has no properties that are set with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-setlight">IDirect3DDevice9::SetLight</a>, the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-lightenable">IDirect3DDevice9::LightEnable</a> method creates a light source with the properties listed in following table and enables or disables it.
