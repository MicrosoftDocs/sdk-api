# IDirect3DDevice9::TestCooperativeLevel


## -description


Reports the current cooperative-level status of the Direct3D device for a windowed or full-screen application.


## -parameters






## -returns



Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/com/structure-of-com-error-codes">HRESULT</a></b>

If the method succeeds, the return value is D3D_OK, indicating that the device is operational and the calling application can continue.
 If the method fails, the return value can be one of the following values: D3DERR_DEVICELOST, D3DERR_DEVICENOTRESET, D3DERR_DRIVERINTERNALERROR.




## -remarks



If the device is lost but cannot be restored at the current time, <b>IDirect3DDevice9::TestCooperativeLevel</b> returns the D3DERR_DEVICELOST return code. This would be the case, for example, when a full-screen device has lost focus. If an application detects a lost device, it should pause and periodically call <b>IDirect3DDevice9::TestCooperativeLevel</b> until it receives a return value of D3DERR_DEVICENOTRESET. The application may then attempt to reset the device by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-reset">IDirect3DDevice9::Reset</a> and, if this succeeds, restore the necessary resources and resume normal operation. Note that <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-present">IDirect3DDevice9::Present</a> will return D3DERR_DEVICELOST if the device is either "lost" or "not reset".

A call to <b>IDirect3DDevice9::TestCooperativeLevel</b> will fail if called on a different thread than that used to create the device being reset.
