# IDirect3DDevice9 interface


## -description

Applications use the methods of the IDirect3DDevice9 interface to perform DrawPrimitive-based rendering, create resources, work with system-level variables, adjust gamma ramp levels, work with palettes, and create shaders.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IDirect3DDevice9</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IDirect3DDevice9</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

The <b>IDirect3DDevice9</b> interface is obtained by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3d9-createdevice">IDirect3D9::CreateDevice</a> method.

This interface, like all COM interfaces, inherits the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface methods.

The LPDIRECT3DDEVICE9 and PDIRECT3DDEVICE9 types are defined as pointers to the <b>IDirect3DDevice9</b> interface.


```

typedef struct IDirect3DDevice9 *LPDIRECT3DDEVICE9, *PDIRECT3DDEVICE9;

```
