# IDirect3DDevice9::CreateAdditionalSwapChain


## -description

Creates an additional swap chain for rendering multiple views.

## -parameters

### -param pPresentationParameters [in, out]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/direct3d9/d3dpresent-parameters">D3DPRESENT_PARAMETERS</a>*</b>

Pointer to a <a href="/windows/desktop/direct3d9/d3dpresent-parameters">D3DPRESENT_PARAMETERS</a> structure, containing the presentation parameters for the new swap chain. This value cannot be <b>NULL</b>.

Calling this method changes the value of members of the D3DPRESENT_PARAMETERS structure.

<ul>
<li>If BackBufferCount == 0, calling CreateAdditionalSwapChain will increase it to 1.</li>
<li>If the application is in windowed mode, and if either the BackBufferWidth or the BackBufferHeight == 0, they will be set to the client area width and height of the hwnd.</li>
</ul>

### -param pSwapChain [out, retval]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d9helper/nn-d3d9helper-idirect3dswapchain9">IDirect3DSwapChain9</a>**</b>

Address of a pointer to an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d9helper/nn-d3d9helper-idirect3dswapchain9">IDirect3DSwapChain9</a> interface, representing the additional swap chain.

## -returns

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/com/structure-of-com-error-codes">HRESULT</a></b>

If the method succeeds, the return value is D3D_OK. If the method fails, the return value can be one of the following: D3DERR_NOTAVAILABLE, D3DERR_DEVICELOST, D3DERR_INVALIDCALL, D3DERR_OUTOFVIDEOMEMORY, E_OUTOFMEMORY.

## -remarks

There is always at least one swap chain (the implicit swap chain) for each device because Direct3D 9 has one swap chain as a property of the device. 

Note that any given device can support only one full-screen swap chain.

D3DFMT_UNKNOWN can be specified for the windowed mode back buffer format when calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3d9-createdevice">IDirect3D9::CreateDevice</a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-reset">IDirect3DDevice9::Reset</a> and CreateAdditionalSwapChain. This means the application does not have to query the current desktop format before calling CreateDevice for windowed mode. For full-screen mode, the back buffer format must be specified.
