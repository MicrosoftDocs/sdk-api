# IDirect3DSurface9::ReleaseDC


## -description

Release a device context handle.

## -parameters

### -param hdc [in]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">HDC</a></b>

Handle to a device context.

## -returns

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/com/structure-of-com-error-codes">HRESULT</a></b>

If the method succeeds, the return value is D3D_OK. D3DERR_INVALIDCALL is returned if the argument is invalid.

## -remarks

An hdc is a Windows resource. It must be released after use so Windows can return it to the pool of available resources.

This method will release only the device context returned by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3dsurface9-getdc">IDirect3DSurface9::GetDC</a>. Otherwise, this method will fail.
