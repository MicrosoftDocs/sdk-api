# IDirect3DDevice9::EndScene


## -description

Ends a scene that was begun by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-beginscene">IDirect3DDevice9::BeginScene</a>.

## -parameters

## -returns

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/com/structure-of-com-error-codes">HRESULT</a></b>

If the method succeeds, the return value is D3D_OK. The method will fail with D3DERR_INVALIDCALL if <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-beginscene">IDirect3DDevice9::BeginScene</a> is called while already in a <b>IDirect3DDevice9::BeginScene</b>/<b>IDirect3DDevice9::EndScene</b> pair. This happens only when <b>IDirect3DDevice9::BeginScene</b> is called twice without first calling <b>IDirect3DDevice9::EndScene</b>.

## -remarks

When this method succeeds, the scene has been queued up for rendering by the driver. This is not a synchronous method, so the scene is not guaranteed to have completed rendering when this method returns.

Applications must call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-beginscene">IDirect3DDevice9::BeginScene</a> before performing any rendering and must call <b>IDirect3DDevice9::EndScene</b> when rendering is complete and before calling <b>IDirect3DDevice9::BeginScene</b> again.

If <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-beginscene">IDirect3DDevice9::BeginScene</a> fails, the device was unable to begin the scene, and there is no need to call <b>IDirect3DDevice9::EndScene</b>. In fact, calls to <b>IDirect3DDevice9::EndScene</b> will fail if the previous <b>IDirect3DDevice9::BeginScene</b> failed. This applies to any application that creates multiple swap chains.

There should be at most one <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-beginscene">IDirect3DDevice9::BeginScene</a>/<b>IDirect3DDevice9::EndScene</b> pair between any successive calls to present (either <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-present">IDirect3DDevice9::Present</a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3dswapchain9-present">IDirect3DSwapChain9::Present</a>). <b>IDirect3DDevice9::BeginScene</b> should be called once before any rendering is performed, and <b>IDirect3DDevice9::EndScene</b> should be called once after all rendering for a frame has been submitted to the runtime. To enable maximal parallelism between the CPU and the graphics accelerator, it is advantageous to call <b>IDirect3DDevice9::EndScene</b> as far ahead of calling present as possible.
