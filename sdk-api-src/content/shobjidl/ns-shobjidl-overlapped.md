# OVERLAPPED structure


## -description


Contains information used in asynchronous (overlapped) input/output (I/O).


## -struct-fields




### -field Internal

Type: <b>ULONG_PTR</b>

Reserved for operating system use. This member, which specifies a system-dependent status, is valid when the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl/nf-shobjidl-istreamasync-overlappedresult">IStreamAsync::OverlappedResult</a> function returns without setting the extended error information to <b>ERROR_IO_PENDING</b>.


### -field InternalHigh

Type: <b>ULONG_PTR</b>

Reserved for operating system use. This member, which specifies the length of the data transferred, is valid when the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl/nf-shobjidl-istreamasync-overlappedresult">IStreamAsync::OverlappedResult</a> function returns <b>TRUE</b>.


### -field Offset

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

File position at which to start the transfer. The file position is a byte offset from the start of the file. The calling process must set this member before it calls the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl/nf-shobjidl-istreamasync-readasync">IStreamAsync::ReadAsync</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl/nf-shobjidl-istreamasync-writeasync">IStreamAsync::WriteAsync</a> function.


### -field OffsetHigh

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

High-order word of the file position at which to start the transfer.


### -field Pointer

Type: <b>PVOID</b>

Reserved.


### -field hEvent

Type: <b>handle</b>

Handle to an event that is set to the signaled state when the operation has been completed. The calling process must set this member either to zero or a valid event handle before it calls any overlapped functions. To create an event object, use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-createeventa">CreateEvent</a> function. This function returns a handle that can be used to synchronize simultaneous I/O requests for a device.

Functions such as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl/nf-shobjidl-istreamasync-readasync">IStreamAsync::ReadAsync</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl/nf-shobjidl-istreamasync-writeasync">IStreamAsync::WriteAsync</a> set this handle to the nonsignaled state before they begin an I/O operation. When the operation has completed, the handle is set to the signaled state.

Functions such as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl/nf-shobjidl-istreamasync-overlappedresult">IStreamAsync::OverlappedResult</a> and the wait functions reset auto-reset events to the nonsignaled state. Therefore, if an auto-reset event is used, the application can stop responding if it waits for the operation to complete and then calls <b>IStreamAsync::OverlappedResult</b>.


## -remarks



This structure should always be initialized to zero before it is used in a function call. If it is not, the function can fail and return <b>ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER</b>.

 Use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl/nf-shobjidl-istreamasync-cancelio">IStreamAsync::CancelIo</a> function to cancel an asynchronous I/O operation.

A common mistake is to reuse an <b>OVERLAPPED</b> structure before the previous asynchronous operation has been completed. Use a separate structure for each request. Create an event object for each thread that processes data.
