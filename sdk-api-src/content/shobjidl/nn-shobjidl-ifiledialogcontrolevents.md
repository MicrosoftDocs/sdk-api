# IFileDialogControlEvents interface


## -description

Exposes methods that allow an application to be notified of events that are related to controls that the application has added to a common file dialog.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IFileDialogControlEvents</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IFileDialogControlEvents</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

<h3><a id="When_to_Implement"></a><a id="when_to_implement"></a><a id="WHEN_TO_IMPLEMENT"></a>When to Implement</h3>
<b>IFileDialogControlEvents</b> is implemented by an application on the same object that it implements <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-ifiledialogevents">IFileDialogEvents</a> in.

The dialog does not check the return values of this interface's methods.
