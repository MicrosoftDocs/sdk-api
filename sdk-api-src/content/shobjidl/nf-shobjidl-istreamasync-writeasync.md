# IStreamAsync::WriteAsync


## -description


Writes information to a stream asynchronously. For example, the Shell implements this method on file items when transferring them asynchronously.


## -parameters




### -param lpBuffer [in]

Type: <b>const void*</b>

A pointer to a buffer of size <i>cb</i> bytes that contains the information to be written to the stream.


### -param cb [in]

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The size of the buffer pointed to by <i>lpBuffer</i>, in bytes.


### -param pcbWritten [out]

Type: <b>LPDWORD</b>

Pointer to a <b>DWORD</b> value that, when the method returns successfully, states the actual number of bytes written to the stream. This value can be <b>NULL</b> if this information is not needed.


### -param lpOverlapped [in]

Type: <b>LPOVERLAPPED</b>

A pointer to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl/ns-shobjidl-overlapped">OVERLAPPED</a> structure that contains information used in the asynchronous write operation.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



<b>WriteAsync</b> should reset the event specified by the <b>hEvent</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl/ns-shobjidl-overlapped">OVERLAPPED</a> structure to a nonsignaled state when it begins the input/output (I/O) operation.
