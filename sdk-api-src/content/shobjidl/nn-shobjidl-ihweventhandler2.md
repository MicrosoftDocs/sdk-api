# IHWEventHandler2 interface


## -description

Extends the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl/nn-shobjidl-ihweventhandler">IHWEventHandler</a> interface to address User Account Control (UAC) elevation for device handlers.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IHWEventHandler2</b> interface inherits from <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl/nn-shobjidl-ihweventhandler">IHWEventHandler</a>. <b>IHWEventHandler2</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

This interface also provides the methods of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl/nn-shobjidl-ihweventhandler">IHWEventHandler</a> interface, from which it inherits.

Handlers that implement this interface should return quickly from calls to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl/nf-shobjidl-ihweventhandler-handleevent">IHWEventHandler::HandleEvent</a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl/nf-shobjidl-ihweventhandler2-handleeventwithhwnd">IHWEventHandler2::HandleEventWithHWND</a> so they do not block the AutoPlay dialog from closing. Also, if a local server must be launched for the creation of this handler, it should not block the CreateInstance call; it should return as soon as possible.
