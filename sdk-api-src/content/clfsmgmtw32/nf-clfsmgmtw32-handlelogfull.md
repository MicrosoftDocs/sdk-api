# HandleLogFull function


## -description


The <b>HandleLogFull</b> function is called by a managed log client when an attempt to reserve or append to a log fails with a log full error message.  The log manager attempts to resolve the log full condition for the client, and notifies the client when the outcome is known. As a result of this call, the log may get larger in size. 


## -parameters




### -param hLog [in]

A handle to the log on which to resolve the log full condition. The handle must have been registered with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/clfsmgmtw32/nf-clfsmgmtw32-registermanageablelogclient">RegisterManageableLogClient</a>.


## -returns



If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero.
						

If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, call 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a>. Valid values include the following:




## -remarks



If containers are created to resolve a log-full condition, they are created using the calling application's security context.

<b>HandleLogFull</b> always results in asynchronous behavior or an error; if it returns false and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a> returns <b>ERROR_IO_PENDING</b>, the result is asynchronous behavior. If a request is asynchronous, a notification is sent to the client when the handler has either  resolved the log full condition or it fails.
