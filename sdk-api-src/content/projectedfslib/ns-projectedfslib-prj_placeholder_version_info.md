# PRJ_PLACEHOLDER_VERSION_INFO structure


## -description


Information that uniquely identifies the contents of a placeholder file.


## -struct-fields




### -field ProviderID

 


### -field ContentID

 




#### - ContentID(PRJ_PLACEHOLDER_ID_LENGTH)

A content identifier, generated by the provider.


#### - ProviderID(PRJ_PLACEHOLDER_ID_LENGTH)

A provider specific identifier.


## -remarks



A provider uses <b>PRJ_PLACEHOLDER_VERSION_INFO</b> to provide information that uniquely identifies the contents of a placeholder file. ProjFS stores the contents of this struct with the file and returns it when invoking callbacks. 


<b>PRJ_PLACEHOLDER_VERSION_INFO</b>.ProviderID is a provider-specific identifier. The provider may use this value as its own unique identifier, for example as a version number for the format of the ContentID field. 


<b>PRJ_PLACEHOLDER_VERSION_INFO</b>.ContentID is a content identifier, generated by the provider. This value is used to distinguish different versions of the same file, i.e. different file contents and/or metadata (e.g. timestamps) for the same file path.
