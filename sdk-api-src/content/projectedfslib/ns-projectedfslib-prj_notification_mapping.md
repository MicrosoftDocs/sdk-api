# PRJ_NOTIFICATION_MAPPING structure


## -description


Describes a notification mapping, which is a pairing between a directory (referred to as a "notification root") and a set of notifications, expressed as a bit mask.


## -struct-fields




### -field NotificationBitMask

A bit mask representing a set of notifications.


### -field NotificationRoot

The directory that the notification mapping is paired to.


## -remarks



PRJ_NOTIFICATION_MAPPING describes a "notification mapping", which is a pairing between a directory (referred to as a "notification root") and a set of notifications, expressed as a bit mask, which ProjFS should send for that directory and its descendants. A notification mapping can also be established for a single file. 


The provider puts an array of zero or more PRJ_NOTIFICATION_MAPPING structures in the NotificationMappings member of the options parameter of PrjStartVirtualizing to configure notifications for the virtualization root. 


If the provider does not specify any notification mappings, ProjFS will default to sending the notifications PRJ_NOTIFICATION_FILE_OPENED, PRJ_NOTIFICATION_NEW_FILE_CREATED, and PRJ_NOTIFICATION_FILE_OVERWRITTEN for all files and directories in the virtualization instance. 


The directory or file is specified relative to the virtualization root, with an empty string representing the virtualization root itself. 


If the provider specifies multiple notification mappings, and some are descendants of others, the mappings must be specified in descending depth. Notification mappings at deeper levels override higher-level ones for their descendants.
