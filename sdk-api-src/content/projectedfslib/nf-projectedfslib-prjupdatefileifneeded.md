# PrjUpdateFileIfNeeded function


## -description


Enables a provider to update an item that has been cached on the local file system.


## -parameters




### -param namespaceVirtualizationContext [in]

Opague handle for the virtualization instance.


### -param destinationFileName [in]

A null-terminated Unicode string specifying the path, relative to the virtualization root, to the file or directory to be updated. 


### -param placeholderInfo [in]

A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/projectedfslib/ns-projectedfslib-prj_placeholder_info">PRJ_PLACEHOLDER_INFO</a> buffer containing the updated metadata for the file or directory. 


If placeholderInfo-&gt;VersionInfo.ContentID contains a content identifier that is the same as the content identifier already on the file/directory, the call succeeds and no update takes place. Otherwise, if the call succeeds then placeholderInfo-&gt;VersionInfo.ContentID replaces the existing content identifier on the file.


### -param placeholderInfoSize [in]

The size in bytes of the buffer pointed to by placeholderInfo.


### -param updateFlags [in, optional]

Flags to control updates.

If the item is a dirty placeholder, full file, or tombstone, and the provider does not specify the appropriate flag(s), this routine will fail to update the placeholder


### -param failureReason [out, optional]

Optional pointer to receive a code describing the reason an update failed.


## -returns



If an HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_FILE_SYSTEM_VIRTUALIZATION_INVALID_OPERATION) error is returned, the update failed due to the item's state and the value of updateFlags. failureReason, if specified, will describe the reason for the failure.




## -remarks



The provider uses this routine to update an item in the local file system if the item's information has changed in the provider’s backing store and the updates should be reflected in the items cached in the local file system. 


This routine cannot be called on a virtual file/directory. 
If the file/directory to be updated is in any state other than "placeholder", the provider must specify an appropriate combination of PRJ_UPDATE_TYPES values in the updateFlags parameter. This helps guard against accidental loss of data, since upon successful return from this routine the item becomes a placeholder with the updated metadata; any metadata that had been changed since the placeholder was created, or any file data it contained is discarded. 


The provider uses the local file system as a cache of the items that it manages. An item (file or directory) can be in one of six states on the local file system.

 Virtual - The item does not exist locally on disk. It is projected, i.e. synthesized, during enumerations of its parent directory. Virtual items are merged with any items that may exist on disk to present the full contents of the parent directory. 


Placeholder - For files: The file's content (primary data stream) is not present on the disk. The file’s metadata (name, size, timestamps, attributes, etc.) is cached on the disk. For directories: Some or all of the directory’s immediate descendants (the files and directories in the directory) are not present on the disk, i.e. they are still virtual. The directory’s metadata (name, timestamps, attributes, etc.) is cached on the disk. 


Hydrated placeholder - For files: The file’s content and metadata have been cached to the disk. Also referred to as a "partial file". For directories: Directories are never hydrated placeholders. A directory that was created on disk as a placeholder never becomes a hydrated placeholder directory. This allows the provider to add or remove items from the directory in its backing store and have those changes be reflected in the local cache. 


Dirty placeholder (hydrated or not) - The item's metadata has been locally modified and is no longer a cache of its state in the provider's store. Note that creating or deleting a file or directory under a placeholder directory causes that placeholder directory to become dirty. 


Full file/directory - For files: The file's content (primary data stream) has been modified. The file is no longer a cache of its state in the provider's store. Files that have been created on the local file system (i.e. that do not exist in the provider's store at all) are also considered to be full files. For directories: Directories that have been created on the local file system (i.e. that do not exist in the provider's store at all) are considered to be full directories. A directory that was created on disk as a placeholder never becomes a full directory. 


Tombstone - A special hidden placeholder that represents an item that has been deleted from the local file system. When a directory is enumerated ProjFS merges the set of local items (placeholders, full files, etc.) with the set of virtual projected items. If an item appears in both the local and projected sets, the local item takes precedence. If a file does not exist, there is no local state, so it would appear in the enumeration. However if that item had been deleted, having it appear in the enumeration would be unexpected. Replacing a deleted item with a tombstone result in the following effects:<ul>
<li>Enumerations to not reveal the item</li>
<li>File opens that expect the item to exist fail with e.g. "file not found".</li>
<li>File creates that expect to succeed only if the item does not exist succeed; ProjFS removes the tombstone as part of the operation.</li>
</ul>


 
To illustrate the above states, consider the following sequence, given a ProjFS provider that has a single file "foo.txt" located in the virtualization root C:\root. 



<ul>
<li>An app enumerates C:\root. It sees the virtual file "foo.txt". Since the file has not yet been accessed, the file does not exist on disk. 
</li>
<li>The app opens a handle to C:\root\foo.txt. ProjFS tells the provider to create a placeholder for it.</li>
<li>The app reads the content of the file. The provider provides the file content to ProjFS and it is cached to C:\root\foo.txt. The file is now a hydrated placeholder.</li>
<li>The app updates the Last Modified timestamp. The file is now a dirty hydrated placeholder.</li>
<li>The app opens a handle for write access to the file. C:\root\foo.txt is now a full file.</li>
<li>The app deletes C:\root\foo.txt. ProjFS replaces the file with a tombstone. Now when the app enumerates C:\root it does not see foo.txt. If it tries to open the file, the open fails with ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND.</li>
</ul>
