## -parameters




### -param iMethod [in]

The method number. If this parameter is -1, the method number will be determined from the data to be unmarshaled.


### -param pBuffer [in]

A pointer to the buffer from which the activation record is to be created.


### -param cbBuffer [in]

The size of the buffer, in bytes.


### -param fForceBufferCopy [in]

Indicates whether the buffer should be copied and retained (nonzero) or the buffer will remain valid (zero).


### -param dataRep [in]

The data representation with which the data was marshaled.


### -param pcontext [in]

A pointer to a <a href="/windows/win32/api/callobj/ns-callobj-callframe_marshalcontext">CALLFRAME_MARSHALCONTEXT</a> structure that contains information about the context in which unmarshaling is to be carried out.


### -param pcbUnmarshalled [out]

A pointer to the number of bytes that were successfully unmarshaled.


### -param ppFrame [out]

A call frame bound to the umarshaled invocation.
