# ISharedBitmap interface


## -description

Exposes memory-efficient methods for accessing bitmaps. This interface is used as a thin wrapper around HBITMAP objects, allowing those objects to be reference counted and protected from having their underlying data changed.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">ISharedBitmap</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>ISharedBitmap</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

This interface is used in conjunction with the methods of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/thumbcache/nn-thumbcache-ithumbnailcache">IThumbnailCache</a>. Bitmaps returned by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/thumbcache/nf-thumbcache-ithumbnailcache-getthumbnail">IThumbnailCache::GetThumbnail</a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/thumbcache/nf-thumbcache-ithumbnailcache-getthumbnailbyid">IThumbnailCache::GetThumbnailByID</a> are of type <b>ISharedBitmap</b>.

When an <b>ISharedBitmap</b> object is retrieved from the thumbnail cache, the underlying bitmap may reside in shared memory to provide improved performance.

The underlying data of the memory-mapped bitmap is protected while the client is accessing it.
