# IThumbnailCache interface


## -description


Exposes methods for a system thumbnail cache that is shared across applications.


## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IThumbnailCache</b> interface inherits from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IThumbnailCache</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -members

The <b>IThumbnailCache</b> interface has these methods.

## -remarks



The Thumbnail Cache API is designed to provide applications with a unified method to retrieve and cache thumbnails. In Windows XP, thumbnail caching is done on a per-folder basis, and the cache is maintained in a Thumbs.db file within each folder. While this approach provides spatial locality, it does not support previews and queries across folders. The thumbnail cache in Windows Vista addresses this shortcoming by providing a global cache.

To cache a thumbnail, an application must first obtain an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-ishellitem">IShellItem</a> that represents the item for which a thumbnail will be obtained, and then pass the <b>IShellItem</b> to a call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/thumbcache/nf-thumbcache-ithumbnailcache-getthumbnail">IThumbnailCache::GetThumbnail</a>. If the flags parameter to <b>IThumbnailCache::GetThumbnail</b> includes the flag WTS_EXTRACT, and the thumbnail is not already cached, a thumbnail will be extracted and placed in the cache. If the flag WTS_FORCEEXTRACTION is set, the cache is ignored and a new thumbnail is always extracted. See the <b>IThumbnailCache::GetThumbnail</b> topic for more details on the flags passed to <b>IThumbnailCache::GetThumbnail</b>.

If a thumbnail is not already in the cache, it will be automatically extracted 
from the source file using the existing implementation(s) of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-iextractimage">IExtractImage</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/thumbcache/nn-thumbcache-ithumbnailprovider">IThumbnailProvider</a> that is registered on the operating system. Your application does not have to provide an implementation of the thumbnail extractor.

When <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/thumbcache/nf-thumbcache-ithumbnailcache-getthumbnail">IThumbnailCache::GetThumbnail</a> returns, its <i>pThumbnailID</i> parameter receives a WTS_THUMBNAILID structure that contains the unique ID of the thumbnail. If this ID is saved, it can then be passed to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/thumbcache/nf-thumbcache-ithumbnailcache-getthumbnailbyid">IThumbnailCache::GetThumbnailByID</a> to retrieve the cached thumbnail. Alternatively, <b>IThumbnailCache::GetThumbnail</b> may be called with the WTS_CACHEONLY flag set. In this case, a thumbnail will be returned only if it is already cached. The disadvantage of using <b>IThumbnailCache::GetThumbnail</b> rather than <b>IThumbnailCache::GetThumbnailByID</b>, is that an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-ishellitem">IShellItem</a> must still be provided.

Multiple threads can be used to access the thumbnail cache to improve performance.
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/thumbcache/nf-thumbcache-ithumbnailcache-getthumbnail">IThumbnailCache::GetThumbnail</a> may be called on a higher priority thread with either the WTS_INCACHEONLY or the WTS_FASTEXTRACT flag set, so that cached thumbnails are retrieved immediately. Then if the image is not in the cache, or WTS_LOWQUALITY indicates the cached image was not of ideal quality, a lower priority thread may be used to call <b>IThumbnailCache::GetThumbnail</b> with the WTS_EXTRACT flag set, 
so that a thumbnail may be extracted.
