# XMQuaternionRotationRollPitchYawFromVector function


## -description


Computes a rotation quaternion based on a vector containing the Euler angles (pitch, yaw, and roll).


## -parameters




### -param Angles [in]

3D vector containing the Euler angles in the order pitch, yaw, roll.


## -returns



Returns the rotation quaternion.




## -remarks



The DirectXMath quaternion functions use an XMVECTOR 4-vector to represent quaternions, 
    where the X, Y, and Z components are the vector part and the W component is the scalar part.

Angles are measured clockwise when looking along the rotation axis toward the origin. This is a left-handed coordinate system. To use right-handed coordinates, negate all three angles.

The order of transformations is roll first, then pitch, then yaw. The rotations are all applied in the global coordinate
   frame.
