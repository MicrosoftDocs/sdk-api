# XMVECTOR::operator / (XMVECTOR,XMVECTOR)


## -description

Divides one instance of **XMVECTOR** by a second instance, returning the result in a third instance.

The `operator /` divides each component of an instance of <a href="/windows/desktop/dxmath/xmvector-data-type">XMVECTOR Data Type</a> by the corresponding component in a second instance of **XMVECTOR**, returning a new **XMVECTOR** instance containing the result.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This operator is only available under C++.</div>

## -parameters

### -param V1

**XMVECTOR** instance whose components are the dividends of the division operation.

### -param V2

**XMVECTOR** instance whose components are the divisors of the division operation.

## -returns

**XMVECTOR** instance whose components are the quotient of the division of each component of V1 by each corresponding component of *V2*.

## -remarks

The following pseudocode demonstrates the operation of this operator:

```cpp
   XMVECTOR V1;
   XMVECTOR V2;
   XMVECTOR Vout;
   Vout.x = V1.x / V2.x;
   Vout.y = V1.y / V2.y;
   Vout.z = V1.z / V2.z;
   Vout.w = V1.w / V2.w;
```
