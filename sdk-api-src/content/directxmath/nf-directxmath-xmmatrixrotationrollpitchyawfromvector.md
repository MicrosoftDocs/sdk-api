# XMMatrixRotationRollPitchYawFromVector function


## -description


Builds a rotation matrix based on a vector containing the Euler angles (pitch, yaw, and roll).


## -parameters




### -param Angles [in]

3D vector containing the Euler angles in the order pitch, then yaw, and then roll.


## -returns



Returns the rotation matrix.




## -remarks



Angles are measured clockwise when looking along the rotation axis toward the origin. This is a left-handed coordinate system. To use right-handed coordinates, negate all three angles.

The order of transformations is roll first, then pitch, and then yaw. The rotations are all applied in the global
   coordinate frame.
