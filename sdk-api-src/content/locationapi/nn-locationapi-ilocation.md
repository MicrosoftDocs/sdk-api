# ILocation interface


## -description

<p class="CCE_Message">[The Win32 Location API is available for use in the operating systems specified in the Requirements section. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, use the <a href="/uwp/api/windows.devices.geolocation">Windows.Devices.Geolocation</a>API.
]

Provides methods used to manage location reports, event registration, and sensor permissions.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">ILocation</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>ILocation</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

When <b>CoCreateInstance</b> is callled to create an <b>ILocation</b> object, it may result in a notification being displayed in the taskbar, and a Location Activity event being logged in Event Viewer, if it is the application's first use of location.
