# RM_FEC_INFO structure


## -description


The <b>RM_FEC_INFO</b> structure specifies settings for using forward error correction (FEC) with Reliable Multicast. This structure is used with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinSock/socket-options">RM_USE_FEC</a> socket option.


## -struct-fields




### -field FECBlockSize

Maximum number of packets that can be sent for any group, including original data and parity packets. Maximum and default value is 255.


### -field FECProActivePackets

Number of packets to send proactively with each group. Use this option when the network is dispersed, and upstream NAK requests would have an impact on throughput.


### -field FECGroupSize

Number of packets to be treated as one group for the purpose of computing parity packets. Group size must be a power of two. In lossy networks, keep the group size relatively small.


### -field fFECOnDemandParityEnabled

Specifies whether the sender is enabled for sending parity repair packets. When <b>TRUE</b>, receivers should only request parity repair packets.


## -remarks



The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinSock/socket-options">RM_USE_FEC</a> socket option notifies the Reliable Multicast sender to apply forward error correction techniques to send repair data. there are three modes of using forward error correction:

<ol>
<li>Pro-active parity packets only</li>
<li>OnDemand parity packets only</li>
<li>Both pro-active and OnDemand parity packets</li>
</ol>
Since the use of this structure implies the need for forward error correction, either the <b>FECProActivePackets</b> or <b>fFECOnDemandParityEnabled</b> member must be nonzero, otherwise the function call fails.
