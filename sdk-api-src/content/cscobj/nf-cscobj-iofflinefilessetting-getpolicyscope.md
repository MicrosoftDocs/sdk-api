# IOfflineFilesSetting::GetPolicyScope


## -description


Retrieves the scope of the policy associated with this setting.


## -parameters




### -param pdwScope [out]

Receives the supported scope of the policy for this setting.  This scope can be one or both of the following values.



#### OFFLINEFILES_SETTING_SCOPE_USER (0x00000001)

The setting supports per-user policy.



#### OFFLINEFILES_SETTING_SCOPE_COMPUTER (0x00000002)

The setting supports per-machine policy.


## -returns



S_OK if the scope is returned successfully or an error value otherwise.




## -remarks



Note that this is an indication of the supported scopes, not of the applied scopes.  For example, a setting may recognize both per-user and per-machine policy yet only the per-user policy has been applied.  In this scenario, this API would return both OFFLINEFILES_SETTING_SCOPE_USER and OFFLINEFILES_SETTING_SCOPE_COMPUTER.
