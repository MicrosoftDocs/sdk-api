# FUSION_INSTALL_REFERENCE structure


## -description


The <b>FUSION_INSTALL_REFERENCE</b> structure contains information about the application which references the side-by-side assembly. The assembly being referenced can be added to or removed from the side-by-side assembly store using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winsxs/nf-winsxs-iassemblycache-installassembly">InstallAssembly</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winsxs/nf-winsxs-iassemblycache-uninstallassembly">UninstallAssembly</a> methods.


## -struct-fields




### -field cbSize

The size of the structure in bytes.


### -field dwFlags

Reserved, this member must be zero.


### -field guidScheme

The application  that uses the side-by-side assembly.


 This parameter can have one of the following values:



<table>

<dt><b>FUSION_REFCOUNT_MSI_GUID</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The assembly is referenced by an application that has been installed by using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Msi/windows-installer-portal">Windows Installer</a>. The <b>szIdentifier</b> member is set to MSI, and <b>szNonCannonicalData</b> is set to Windows Installer. Use this value for Windows side-by-side assemblies.
