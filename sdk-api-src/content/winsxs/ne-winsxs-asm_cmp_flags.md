# ASM_CMP_FLAGS enumeration


## -description

The values of the <b>ASM_CMP_FLAGS</b> enumeration are used by the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsxs/nf-winsxs-iassemblyname-isequal">IsEqual</a> method to specify which portions of two assembly names to compare.

## -enum-fields

### -field ASM_CMPF_NAME

Compare the name portion of the assembly names.

### -field ASM_CMPF_MAJOR_VERSION

Compare the major version portion of the assembly names.

### -field ASM_CMPF_MINOR_VERSION

Compare the minor version portion of the assembly names.

### -field ASM_CMPF_BUILD_NUMBER

Compare the build version portion of the assembly names.

### -field ASM_CMPF_REVISION_NUMBER

Compare the revision version portion of the assembly names.

### -field ASM_CMPF_PUBLIC_KEY_TOKEN

Compare the public key token portion of the assembly names.

### -field ASM_CMPF_CULTURE

Compare the culture portion of the assembly names.

### -field ASM_CMPF_CUSTOM

Compare the custom portion of the assembly names.

### -field ASM_CMPF_ALL

Compare all portions of the assembly names. This is equivalent to setting:

```
ASM_CMPF_NAME | ASM_CMPF_MAJOR_VERSION | ASM_CMPF_MINOR_VERSION | ASM_CMPF_REVISION_NUMBER | ASM_CMPF_BUILD_NUMBER | ASM_CMPF_PUBLIC_KEY_TOKEN | ASM_CMPF_CULTURE | ASM_CMPF_CUSTOM
```

### -field ASM_CMPF_DEFAULT

 Ignore the version number to compare assemblies with simple names.
