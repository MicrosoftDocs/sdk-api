# IDirectDrawSurface7::GetLOD


## -description


Retrieves the maximum level of detail (LOD) currently set for a managed mipmap surface. This method succeeds only on managed textures.



## -parameters






#### - lpdwMaxLOD [out]

A pointer to a variable that receives the maximum LOD value if the call succeeds.


## -returns



If the method succeeds, the return value is DD_OK.



If it fails, the method can return one of the following error values:

<ul>
<li>DDERR_INVALIDOBJECT</li>
<li>DDERR_INVALIDPARAMS</li>
</ul>



## -remarks



Applications can call this method only for managed textures (those surfaces that were created with the DDSCAPS2_TEXTUREMANAGE flag). If you call <b>GetLOD</b> on a nonmanaged texture, <b>GetLOD</b> fails and returns DDERR_INVALIDOBJECT.

<b>GetLOD</b> communicates to the Direct3D texture manager the most detailed mipmap in this chain that it should load into local video memory. For example, in a five-level mipmap chain, a value of 2 in the variable at <i>lpdwMaxLOD</i> indicates that the texture manager loads only mipmap levels 2 through 4 into local video memory at any given time. Likewise, if the most detailed mipmap in the chain has the dimensions 256×256, a value of 2 in <i>lpdwMaxLOD</i> means that the largest mipmap ever present in video memory has dimensions 64×64.



You must use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya">LoadLibrary</a> to explicitly link to Ddraw.dll and then use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress">GetProcAddress</a> to access the  <b>GetLOD</b> method.
