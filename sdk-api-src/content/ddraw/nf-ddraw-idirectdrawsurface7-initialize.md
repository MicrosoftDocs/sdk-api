# IDirectDrawSurface7::Initialize


## -description

Initializes a DirectDrawSurface object.

## -parameters

### -param unnamedParam1 [in]

A pointer to the DirectDraw object to associate with the DirectDrawSurface object.

### -param unnamedParam2 [in]

A pointer to a <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff550340(v=vs.85)">DDSURFACEDESC2</a> structure that describes how to initialize this surface.

## -returns

This method returns DDERR_ALREADYINITIALIZED.

This method is provided for compliance with the Component Object Model (COM). Because the DirectDrawSurface object is initialized when it is created, this method always returns DDERR_ALREADYINITIALIZED.

## -remarks

You must use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya">LoadLibrary</a> to explicitly link to Ddraw.dll and then use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress">GetProcAddress</a> to access the  <b>Initialize</b> method.
