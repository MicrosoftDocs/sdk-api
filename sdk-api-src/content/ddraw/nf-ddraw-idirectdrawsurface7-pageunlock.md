# IDirectDrawSurface7::PageUnlock


## -description


Unlocks a system-memory surface, which then allows it to be paged out.


## -parameters






#### - dwFlags [in]

Currently not used and must be set to 0.


## -returns



If the method succeeds, the return value is DD_OK.



If it fails, the method can return one of the following error values:

<ul>
<li>DDERR_CANTPAGEUNLOCK</li>
<li>DDERR_INVALIDOBJECT</li>
<li>DDERR_INVALIDPARAMS</li>
<li>DDERR_NOTPAGELOCKED</li>
<li>DDERR_SURFACELOST</li>
</ul>



## -remarks



A lock count is maintained for each surface and is incremented each time that <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ddraw/nf-ddraw-idirectdrawsurface7-pagelock">IDirectDrawSurface7::PageLock</a> is called for that surface. The count is decremented when <b>PageUnlock</b> is called. When the count reaches 0, the memory is unlocked, and can then be paged by the operating system.

<b>PageUnlock</b> works only on system-memory surfaces; it does not page-unlock a display-memory surface or an emulated primary surface. If an application calls <b>PageUnlock</b> on a display memory surface, the method does nothing except return DD_OK.



<b>IDirectDrawSurface7::PageUnlock</b> was not implemented in the <b>IDirectDraw</b> interface version.



You must use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya">LoadLibrary</a> to explicitly link to Ddraw.dll and then use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress">GetProcAddress</a> to access the <b>PageUnlock</b> method.
