# IDirectDrawSurface7::GetAttachedSurface


## -description

Obtains the attached surface that has the specified capabilities, and increments the reference count of the retrieved interface.

## -parameters

### -param arg1 [in]

A pointer to a <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff550292(v=vs.85)">DDSCAPS2</a> structure that indicates the hardware capabilities of the attached surface.

### -param arg2 [out]

A pointer to a variable to receive a pointer to the retrieved surface's <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ddraw/nn-ddraw-idirectdrawsurface7">IDirectDrawSurface7</a> interface. The retrieved surface is the one that matches the description, according to the <i>lpDDSCaps</i> parameter.

## -returns

If the method succeeds, the return value is DD_OK.



If it fails, the method can return one of the following error values:

<ul>
<li>DDERR_INVALIDOBJECT</li>
<li>DDERR_INVALIDPARAMS</li>
<li>DDERR_NOTFOUND</li>
<li>DDERR_SURFACELOST</li>
</ul>

## -remarks

Attachments are used to connect multiple DirectDrawSurface objects into complex structures, like the complex structures required to support 3-D page flipping with z-buffers. <b>GetAttachedSurface</b> fails if more than one surface is attached that matches the capabilities requested. In this case, the application must use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ddraw/nf-ddraw-idirectdrawsurface7-enumattachedsurfaces">IDirectDrawSurface7::EnumAttachedSurfaces</a> method to obtain the attached surfaces.



You must use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya">LoadLibrary</a> to explicitly link to Ddraw.dll and then use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress">GetProcAddress</a> to access the  <b>GetAttachedSurface</b> method.
