## -description

Retrieves the capabilities of this surface. These capabilities are not necessarily related to the capabilities of the display device.

## -parameters

### -param unnamedParam1 [in]

A pointer to a <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff550292(v=vs.85)">DDSCAPS2</a> structure that receives the hardware capabilities of this surface.

## -returns

If the method succeeds, the return value is DD_OK.

If it fails, the method can return one of the following error values:

<ul>
<li>DDERR_INVALIDOBJECT</li>
<li>DDERR_INVALIDPARAMS</li>
</ul>

## -remarks

The <b>IDirectDrawSurface7::GetCaps</b> method differs from its counterpart in the <b>IDirectDrawSurface3</b> interface in that it accepts a pointer to a <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff550292(v=vs.85)">DDSCAPS2</a> structure, rather than the legacy <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff550286(v=vs.85)">DDSCAPS</a> structure.

You must use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya">LoadLibrary</a> to explicitly link to Ddraw.dll and then use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress">GetProcAddress</a> to access the  <b>GetCaps</b> method.
