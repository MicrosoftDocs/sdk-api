## -description

Assigns the texture-management priority for this texture. This method succeeds only on managed textures.

## -parameters

### -param arg1 [in]

A value that specifies the new texture-management priority for the texture.

## -returns

If the method succeeds, the return value is DD_OK.

If it fails, the return value is an error. The method returns DDERR_INVALIDOBJECT if the parameter is invalid or if the texture is not managed by Direct3D.

## -remarks

<b>SetPriority</b> was introduced with the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ddraw/nn-ddraw-idirectdrawsurface7">IDirectDrawSurface7</a> interface.

Priorities are used to determine when managed textures are to be removed from memory. A texture assigned a low priority is removed before a texture with a high priority. If two textures have the same priority, the texture that was used more recently is kept in memory; the other texture is removed.

Applications can set and retrieve priorities only for managed textures (those surfaces that were created with the DDSCAPS2_TEXTUREMANAGE flag). If you call <b>SetPriority</b> on a nonmanaged texture, <b>SetPriority</b> fails and returns DDERR_INVALIDOBJECT.

You must use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya">LoadLibrary</a> to explicitly link to Ddraw.dll and then use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress">GetProcAddress</a> to access the  <b>SetPriority</b> method.
