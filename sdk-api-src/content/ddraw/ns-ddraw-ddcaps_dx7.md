## -description

The DDCAPS structure represents the capabilities of the hardware exposed through the DirectDraw object. This structure contains a <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff550292(v=vs.85)">DDSCAPS2</a> structure used in this context to describe what kinds of DirectDrawSurface objects can be created. It might not be possible to create all the surfaces described by these capabilities simultaneously. This structure is used with the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ddraw/nf-ddraw-idirectdraw7-getcaps">IDirectDraw7::GetCaps</a> method.



The Ddraw.h header file contains multiple versions of this structure (for example, DDCAPS_DX7). For more information about how to determine which version to use, see Remarks.

## -struct-fields

### -field dwSize

Size of the structure, in bytes. This member must be initialized before the structure is used.

### -field dwCaps

This value consists of one or more of the following flags that specify hardware and driver capabilities:

Display hardware is capable of bit block transfer (bitblt) operations.



#### DDCAPS_BLTCOLORFILL

Display hardware is capable of color filling with a blitter.



#### DDCAPS_BLTDEPTHFILL

Display hardware is capable of depth filling z-buffers with a blitter.

### -field dwCaps2

This value consists of one or more of the following flags that specify more hardware and driver capabilities:



#### DDCAPS2_AUTOFLIPOVERLAY

The overlay can be automatically flipped to the next surface in the flipping chain each time that a video port VSYNC occurs, allowing the video port and the overlay to double-buffer the video without CPU overhead. This option is only valid when the surface is receiving data from a video port. If the video port data is noninterlaced or noninterleaved, it flips on every VSYNC. If the data is being interleaved in memory, it flips on every other VSYNC.



#### DDCAPS2_CANBOBHARDWARE

The overlay hardware can display each field of an interlaced video stream individually.



#### DDCAPS2_CANBOBINTERLEAVED

The overlay hardware can display each field of an interlaced video stream individually while it is interleaved in memory without causing any artifacts that might normally occur without special hardware support. This option is only valid when the surface is receiving data from a video port and the video is zoomed at least twice in the vertical direction.



#### DDCAPS2_CANBOBNONINTERLEAVED

The overlay hardware can display each field of an interlaced video stream individually while it is not interleaved in memory without causing any artifacts that might normally occur without special hardware support. This option is only valid when the surface is receiving data from a video port and the video is zoomed at least twice in the vertical direction.



#### DDCAPS2_CANCALIBRATEGAMMA

The system has a calibrator installed that can automatically adjust the gamma ramp so that the result is identical on all systems that have a calibrator. To invoke the calibrator when setting new gamma levels, use the DDSGR_CALIBRATE flag when calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ddraw/nf-ddraw-idirectdrawgammacontrol-setgammaramp">IDirectDrawGammaControl::SetGammaRamp</a> method. Calibrating gamma ramps incurs some processing overhead and should not be used frequently.



#### DDCAPS2_CANDROPZ16BIT

Sixteen-bit RGBZ values can be converted into 16-bit RGB values. (The system does not support 8-bit conversions.)



#### DDCAPS2_CANFLIPODDEVEN

The driver is capable of performing odd and even flip operations, as specified by the DDFLIP_ODD and DDFLIP_EVEN flags that are used with the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ddraw/nf-ddraw-idirectdrawsurface7-flip">IDirectDrawSurface7::Flip</a> method.



#### DDCAPS2_CANMANAGETEXTURE

The Direct3D texture manager uses this capability to decide whether to put managed surfaces in nonlocal video memory. If the capability is set, the texture manager puts managed surfaces in nonlocal video memory. Drivers that cannot texture from local video memory should not set this capability.



#### DDCAPS2_CANRENDERWINDOWED

The driver is capable of rendering in windowed mode.



#### DDCAPS2_CERTIFIED

Display hardware is certified.



#### DDCAPS2_COLORCONTROLPRIMARY

The primary surface contains color controls (for instance, gamma).



#### DDCAPS2_COLORCONTROLOVERLAY

The overlay surface contains color controls (such as brightness and sharpness).



#### DDCAPS2_COPYFOURCC

The driver supports blitting any FOURCC surface to another surface of the same FOURCC.



#### DDCAPS2_FLIPINTERVAL

The driver responds to the DDFLIP_INTERVAL* flags. (For more information about these flags, see <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ddraw/nf-ddraw-idirectdrawsurface7-flip">IDirectDrawSurface7::Flip</a>). 




#### DDCAPS2_FLIPNOVSYNC

The driver responds to the DDFLIP_NOVSYNC flag (For more information about this flag, see <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ddraw/nf-ddraw-idirectdrawsurface7-flip">IDirectDrawSurface7::Flip</a>).



#### DDCAPS2_NO2DDURING3DSCENE

Two-dimensional operations such as <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ddraw/nf-ddraw-idirectdrawsurface7-blt">IDirectDrawSurface7::Blt</a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ddraw/nf-ddraw-idirectdrawsurface7-lock">IDirectDrawSurface7::Lock</a> cannot be performed on any surfaces that Direct3D is using between calls to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-beginscene">BeginScene</a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-endscene">EndScene</a> methods.



#### DDCAPS2_NONLOCALVIDMEM

The display driver supports surfaces in nonlocal video memory.



#### DDCAPS2_NONLOCALVIDMEMCAPS

Bitblt capabilities for nonlocal video-memory surfaces differ from local video-memory surfaces. If this flag is present, the DDCAPS2_NONLOCALVIDMEM flag is also present.



#### DDCAPS2_NOPAGELOCKREQUIRED

DMA bitblt operations are supported on system-memory surfaces that are not page-locked.



#### DDCAPS2_PRIMARYGAMMA

Supports dynamic gamma ramps for the primary surface.



#### DDCAPS2_STEREO

New for DirectX 7.0. Turns on the <b>dwSVCaps</b> bit to support stereo mode. The driver can do stereo in at least one mode other than the current mode. The application can use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ddraw/nf-ddraw-idirectdraw7-getdisplaymode">IDirectDraw7::GetDisplayMode</a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ddraw/nf-ddraw-idirectdraw7-enumdisplaymodes">IDirectDraw7::EnumDisplayModes</a> to get per-mode stereo information.



#### DDCAPS2_TEXMANINNONLOCALVIDMEM

New for DirectX 7.0. The Direct3D texture manager uses this capability to decide whether to put managed surfaces in nonlocal video memory. If the capability is set, the texture manager puts managed surfaces in nonlocal video memory. Drivers that cannot texture from local video memory should not set this capability.



#### DDCAPS2_VIDEOPORT

Display hardware supports live video.



#### DDCAPS2_WIDESURFACES

The display surface supports surfaces wider than the primary surface.
