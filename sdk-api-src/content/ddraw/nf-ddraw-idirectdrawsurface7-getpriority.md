# IDirectDrawSurface7::GetPriority


## -description


Retrieves the texture-management priority for this texture. This method succeeds only on managed textures.



## -parameters






#### - lpdwPriority [out]

A pointer to a variable that receives the texture priority if the call succeeds.


## -returns



If the method succeeds, the return value is DD_OK.



If it fails, the return value is an error. The method returns DDERR_INVALIDOBJECT if the parameter is invalid or if the texture is not managed by Direct3D.






## -remarks



Priorities are used to determine when managed textures are to be removed from memory. A texture assigned a low priority is removed before a texture with a high priority. If two textures have the same priority, the texture that was used more recently is kept in memory; the other texture is removed.



Applications can set and retrieve priorities only for managed textures (those surfaces that were created with the DDSCAPS2_TEXTUREMANAGE flag). If you call <b>GetPriority</b> on a nonmanaged texture, <b>GetPriority</b> fails and returns DDERR_INVALIDOBJECT.

<b>GetPriority</b> was introduced with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ddraw/nn-ddraw-idirectdrawsurface7">IDirectDrawSurface7</a> interface.

You must use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya">LoadLibrary</a> to explicitly link to Ddraw.dll and then use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress">GetProcAddress</a> to access the  <b>GetPriority</b> method.
