# IDirectDrawSurface7::EnumAttachedSurfaces


## -description


Enumerates all the surfaces that are attached to this surface.


## -parameters




### -param arg1 [in]

Address of the application-defined structure that is passed to the enumeration member every time that it is called.


### -param arg2 [in]

Address of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ddraw/nc-ddraw-lpddenumsurfacescallback7">EnumSurfacesCallback7</a> function to be called for each surface that is attached to this surface.


## -returns



If the method succeeds, the return value is DD_OK.



If it fails, the method can return one of the following error values:

<ul>
<li>DDERR_INVALIDOBJECT</li>
<li>DDERR_INVALIDPARAMS</li>
<li>DDERR_SURFACELOST</li>
</ul>



## -remarks



<b>EnumAttachedSurfaces</b> enumerates only those surfaces that are directly attached to this surface. For example, in a flipping chain of three or more surfaces, only one surface is enumerated because each surface is attached only to the next surface in the flipping chain. In such a configuration, you can call <b>EnumAttachedSurfaces</b> on each successive surface to walk the entire flipping chain.

<b>EnumAttachedSurfaces</b> differs from its counterparts in previous interface versions in that it accepts a pointer to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ddraw/nc-ddraw-lpddenumsurfacescallback7">EnumSurfacesCallback7</a> function, rather than an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ddraw/nc-ddraw-lpddenumsurfacescallback">EnumSurfacesCallback</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ddraw/nc-ddraw-lpddenumsurfacescallback2">EnumSurfacesCallback2</a> function.



You must use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya">LoadLibrary</a> to explicitly link to Ddraw.dll and then use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress">GetProcAddress</a> to access the <b>EnumAttachedSurfaces</b> method.
