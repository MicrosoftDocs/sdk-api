# IRemoteDesktopClientTouchPointer interface


## -description



Provides the properties needed to control the touch pointer feature of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) app container client control.



The touch pointer feature allows the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) app container client control to translate touch screen actions on the 
    client into equivalent mouse actions in the remote session. This feature is useful when the remote session is 
    running an operating system or application that is not optimized for touch screen. When the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/TermServ/iremotedesktopclienttouchpointer-enabled">Enabled</a> property is set, the 
    RDP app container client control will interpret certain touch gestures and translate them into mouse events in the 
    remote session. These translations make it easier for the user to simulate certain mouse actions that do not 
    readily translate to touch screen gestures, such as right-click and drag.

The following is a list of client touch-screen gestures and their corresponding remote session mouse events.
