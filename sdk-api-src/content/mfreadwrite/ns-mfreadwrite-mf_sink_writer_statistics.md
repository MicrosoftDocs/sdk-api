# MF_SINK_WRITER_STATISTICS structure


## -description


Contains statistics about the performance of the sink writer.


## -struct-fields




### -field cb

The size of the structure, in bytes.


### -field llLastTimestampReceived

The time stamp of the most recent sample given to the sink writer. The sink writer updates this value each time the application calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfreadwrite/nf-mfreadwrite-imfsinkwriter-writesample">IMFSinkWriter::WriteSample</a>.


### -field llLastTimestampEncoded

The time stamp of the most recent sample to be encoded. The sink writer updates this value whenever it calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mftransform/nf-mftransform-imftransform-processoutput">IMFTransform::ProcessOutput</a> on the encoder.


### -field llLastTimestampProcessed

The time stamp of the most recent sample given to the media sink. The sink writer updates this value whenever it calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfidl/nf-mfidl-imfstreamsink-processsample">IMFStreamSink::ProcessSample</a> on the media sink.


### -field llLastStreamTickReceived

The time stamp of the most recent stream tick. The sink writer updates this value whenever the application calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfreadwrite/nf-mfreadwrite-imfsinkwriter-sendstreamtick">IMFSinkWriter::SendStreamTick</a>.


### -field llLastSinkSampleRequest

The system time of the most recent sample request from the media sink. The sink writer updates this value whenever it receives an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/medfound/mestreamsinkrequestsample">MEStreamSinkRequestSample</a> event from the media sink. The value is the current system time.


### -field qwNumSamplesReceived

The number of samples received.


### -field qwNumSamplesEncoded

The number of samples encoded.


### -field qwNumSamplesProcessed

The number of samples given to the media sink.


### -field qwNumStreamTicksReceived

The number of stream ticks received.


### -field dwByteCountQueued

The amount of data, in bytes, currently waiting to be processed. 


### -field qwByteCountProcessed

The total amount of data, in bytes, that has been sent to the media sink.


### -field dwNumOutstandingSinkSampleRequests

The number of pending sample requests.


### -field dwAverageSampleRateReceived

The average rate, in media samples per 100-nanoseconds, at which the application sent samples to the sink writer.


### -field dwAverageSampleRateEncoded

The average rate, in media samples per 100-nanoseconds, at which the sink writer sent samples to the encoder.


### -field dwAverageSampleRateProcessed

The average rate, in media samples per 100-nanoseconds, at which the sink writer sent samples to the media sink.
