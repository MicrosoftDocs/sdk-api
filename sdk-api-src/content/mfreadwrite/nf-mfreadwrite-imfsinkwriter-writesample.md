# IMFSinkWriter::WriteSample


## -description


Delivers a sample to the sink writer.


## -parameters




### -param dwStreamIndex [in]

The zero-based index of the stream for this sample.


### -param pSample [in]

A pointer to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfobjects/nn-mfobjects-imfsample">IMFSample</a> interface of the sample.


## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b><b>S_OK</b></b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method succeeded.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b><b>MF_E_INVALIDREQUEST</b></b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The request is invalid.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



You must call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfreadwrite/nf-mfreadwrite-imfsinkwriter-beginwriting">IMFSinkWriter::BeginWriting</a> before calling this method. Otherwise, the method returns <b>MF_E_INVALIDREQUEST</b>.

By default, the sink writer limits the rate of incoming data by blocking the calling thread inside the <b>WriteSample</b> method. This prevents the application from delivering samples too quickly. To disable this behavior, set the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/medfound/mf-sink-writer-disable-throttling">MF_SINK_WRITER_DISABLE_THROTTLING</a> attribute when you create the sink writer.

This interface is available on Windows Vista if Platform Update Supplement for Windows Vista is installed.
