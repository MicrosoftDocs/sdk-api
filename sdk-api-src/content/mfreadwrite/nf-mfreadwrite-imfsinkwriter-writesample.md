# IMFSinkWriter::WriteSample


## -description

Delivers a sample to the sink writer.

## -parameters

### -param dwStreamIndex [in]

The zero-based index of the stream for this sample.

### -param pSample [in]

A pointer to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mfobjects/nn-mfobjects-imfsample">IMFSample</a> interface of the sample.

## -returns

The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

<table>
<tr>

## -remarks

You must call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mfreadwrite/nf-mfreadwrite-imfsinkwriter-beginwriting">IMFSinkWriter::BeginWriting</a> before calling this method. Otherwise, the method returns <b>MF_E_INVALIDREQUEST</b>.

By default, the sink writer limits the rate of incoming data by blocking the calling thread inside the <b>WriteSample</b> method. This prevents the application from delivering samples too quickly. To disable this behavior, set the <a href="/windows/desktop/medfound/mf-sink-writer-disable-throttling">MF_SINK_WRITER_DISABLE_THROTTLING</a> attribute when you create the sink writer.

This interface is available on Windows Vista if Platform Update Supplement for Windows Vista is installed.
