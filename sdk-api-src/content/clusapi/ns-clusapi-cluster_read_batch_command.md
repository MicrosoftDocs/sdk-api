The pointers in the <b>CLUSTER_READ_BATCH_COMMAND</b> structure are valid until the read batch result handle is closed by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/clusapi/nf-clusapi-clusterregclosereadbatchreply">ClusterRegCloseReadBatchReply</a> function.

Errors from read commands are independent from each other.
