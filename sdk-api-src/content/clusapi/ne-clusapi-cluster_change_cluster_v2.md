Defines the list of notifications that are generated for a cluster.

## -enum-fields

### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_RECONNECT_V2:0x00000001

Indicates that a reconnect procedure occurred. This notification applies to clients only.

### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_STATE_V2:0x00000002

Indicates that a cluster state changed. This notification applies to clients only.

### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_GROUP_ADDED_V2:0x00000004

Indicates that a new group was created.

### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_HANDLE_CLOSE_V2:0x00000008

Indicates that a context handle was closed. This notification applies to clients only.

### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_NETWORK_ADDED_V2:0x00000010

Indicates that a cluster network was added to the cluster.

### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_NODE_ADDED_V2:0x00000020

Indicates that a node was added to the cluster. Nodes are added to a cluster in an implementation-specific way.

### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_TYPE_ADDED_V2:0x00000040

Indicates that a new resource type was added to the cluster.

### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_COMMON_PROPERTY_V2:0x00000080

Indicates that a cluster common property changed.

### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_PRIVATE_PROPERTY_V2:0x00000100

Indicates that a cluster private property changed.

### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_LOST_NOTIFICATIONS_V2:0x00000200

Indicates that notifications might have been lost due to a transient condition on the server.

### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_RENAME_V2:0x00000400

Indicates that the cluster's name changed.

### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_MEMBERSHIP_V2:0x00000800

Indicates that the cluster's membership changed.

### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_UPGRADED_V2:0x00001000

Indicates that the cluster upgraded the Cluster service.

<b>Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2012:  </b>This value is not supported until Windows Server 2016.

### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_ALL_V2

Indicates all V2 cluster notifications.

<b>Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2012:  </b>The value of this constant is  4095 (0x0FFF).
