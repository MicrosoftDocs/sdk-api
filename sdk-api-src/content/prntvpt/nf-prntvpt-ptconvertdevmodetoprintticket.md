# PTConvertDevModeToPrintTicket function


## -description

Converts a <a href="/windows/win32/api/wingdi/ns-wingdi-devmodea">DEVMODE</a> structure to a print ticket inside an <a href="/windows/desktop/Stg/istream-compound-file-implementation">IStream</a>.

## -parameters

### -param hProvider [in]

A handle to an open print ticket provider. This handle is returned by the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/prntvpt/nf-prntvpt-ptopenprovider">PTOpenProvider</a> or the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/prntvpt/nf-prntvpt-ptopenproviderex">PTOpenProviderEx</a> function.

### -param cbDevmode

The size of the <a href="/windows/win32/api/wingdi/ns-wingdi-devmodea">DEVMODE</a> in bytes.

### -param pDevmode [in]

A pointer to the <a href="/windows/win32/api/wingdi/ns-wingdi-devmodea">DEVMODE</a>.

### -param scope [in]

A value that specifies the scope of <i>pPrintTicket</i>. This value can specify a single page, an entire document, or all documents in the print job. Settings in <i>pDevmode</i> that are outside the specified scope will not be included in <i>pPrintTicket</i>. See Remarks.

### -param pPrintTicket

A pointer to an <a href="/windows/desktop/Stg/istream-compound-file-implementation">IStream</a> with its seek position at the beginning of the print ticket.

## -returns

If the operation succeeds, the return value is S_OK, otherwise the <b>HRESULT</b> contains an error code.

If <i>hProvider</i> was opened in a different thread, the <b>HRESULT</b> is E_INVALIDARG.

For more information about COM error codes, see <a href="/windows/desktop/SetupApi/error-handling">Error Handling</a>.

## -remarks

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This is a blocking or synchronous function and might not return immediately. How quickly this function returns depends on run-time factors such as network status, print server configuration, and printer driver implementation—factors that are difficult to predict when writing an application. Calling this function from a thread that manages interaction with the user interface could make the application appear to be unresponsive.</div>
<div> </div>
<i>hProvider</i> must be a handle that was opened in the same thread as the thread in which it is used for this function.
      

If the <i>pDevmode</i> points to a different printer, its settings may be lost and replaced with defaults.

Settings in <i>pDevmode</i> that are outside the <i>scope</i> are not included in <i>pPrintTicket</i>. For example, if the scope is a single page, then job-wide settings and document-wide settings are not included. A job scope includes document scope and page scope. A document scope includes page scope.

<b>PTConvertDevModeToPrintTicket</b> writes the print ticket to the <a href="/windows/desktop/Stg/istream-compound-file-implementation">IStream</a> referenced by <i>pPrintTicket</i> starting at the stream's current seek point. After <b>PTConvertDevModeToPrintTicket</b> returns, the caller must reset the seek point to the initial seek point to read the print ticket returned by the function.
