# PTReleaseMemory function


## -description

Releases buffers associated with print tickets and print capabilities.

## -parameters

### -param pBuffer [in]

A pointer to a buffer allocated during a call to a print ticket API.

## -returns

If the operation succeeds, the return value is S_OK, otherwise the <b>HRESULT</b> contains an error code.

For more information about COM error codes, see <a href="/windows/desktop/SetupApi/error-handling">Error Handling</a>.

## -remarks

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This is a blocking or synchronous function and might not return immediately. How quickly this function returns depends on run-time factors such as network status, print server configuration, and printer driver implementation—factors that are difficult to predict when writing an application. Calling this function from a thread that manages interaction with the user interface could make the application appear to be unresponsive.</div>

Use this function to release the <a href="/windows/win32/api/wingdi/ns-wingdi-devmodea">DEVMODE</a> buffer returned by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/prntvpt/nf-prntvpt-ptconvertprinttickettodevmode">PTConvertPrintTicketToDevMode</a>.
