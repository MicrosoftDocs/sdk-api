# PTCloseProvider function


## -description

Closes a print ticket provider handle.

## -parameters

### -param hProvider [in]

A handle to the provider. This handle is returned by the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/prntvpt/nf-prntvpt-ptopenprovider">PTOpenProvider</a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/prntvpt/nf-prntvpt-ptopenproviderex">PTOpenProviderEx</a> function.

## -returns

If the operation succeeds, the return value is S_OK, otherwise the <b>HRESULT</b> contains an error code.

If <i>hProvider</i> was opened in a different thread, the <b>HRESULT</b> is E_INVALIDARG.

For more information about COM error codes, see <a href="/windows/desktop/SetupApi/error-handling">Error Handling</a>.

## -remarks

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This is a blocking or synchronous function and might not return immediately. How quickly this function returns depends on run-time factors such as network status, print server configuration, and printer driver implementation—factors that are difficult to predict when writing an application. Calling this function from a thread that manages interaction with the user interface could make the application appear to be unresponsive.</div>
<div> </div>
The <i>hProvider</i> parameter must be a handle that was opened in the same thread as the thread in which it is used for this function. 
      

A handle cannot be used after it is closed.
