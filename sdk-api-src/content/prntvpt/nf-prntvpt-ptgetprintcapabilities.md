# PTGetPrintCapabilities function


## -description

Retrieves the printer's capabilities formatted in compliance with the XML <a href="/windows/desktop/printdocs/printschema">Print Schema</a>.

## -parameters

### -param hProvider [in]

A handle to an open provider whose print capabilities are to be retrieved. This handle is returned by the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/prntvpt/nf-prntvpt-ptopenprovider">PTOpenProvider</a> or the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/prntvpt/nf-prntvpt-ptopenproviderex">PTOpenProviderEx</a> function.

### -param pPrintTicket [in]

A pointer to a stream with its seek position at the beginning of the print ticket content. This parameter can be <b>NULL</b>.

### -param pCapabilities

A pointer to the stream where the print capabilities will be written, starting at the current seek position.

### -param pbstrErrorMessage [out]

A pointer to a string that specifies what, if anything, is invalid about <i>pPrintTicket</i>. If it is valid, this value is <b>NULL</b>.

## -returns

If the operation succeeds, the return value is S_OK.

If <i>hProvider</i> was opened in a different thread, the <b>HRESULT</b> is E_INVALIDARG.

If the <i>pPrintTicket</i> is not compliant with the <a href="/windows/desktop/printdocs/printschema">Print Schema</a> , the <b>HRESULT</b> is E_PRINTTICKET_FORMAT.

If the <i>pCapabilities</i> is not compliant with the <a href="/windows/desktop/printdocs/printschema">Print Schema</a> , the <b>HRESULT</b> is E_PRINTCAPABILITIES_FORMAT.

If <i>hProvider</i> was opened in a different thread, the <b>HRESULT</b> is E_INVALIDARG.

Otherwise, another error code is returned in the <b>HRESULT</b>. For more information about COM error codes, see <a href="/windows/desktop/SetupApi/error-handling">Error Handling</a>.

## -remarks

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This is a blocking or synchronous function and might not return immediately. How quickly this function returns depends on run-time factors such as network status, print server configuration, and printer driver implementation—factors that are difficult to predict when writing an application. Calling this function from a thread that manages interaction with the user interface could make the application appear to be unresponsive.</div>
<div> </div>
<i>hProvider</i> must be a handle that was opened in the same thread as the thread in which it is used for this function. 
      

The printer driver uses <i>pPrintTicket</i> values (when the value is not <b>NULL</b>) to create settings when the driver produces printer capabilities that vary depending on the current settings.

When the function returns, the seek position of <i>pPrintTicket</i> is at the end of the print ticket content and the seek position of <i>pCapabilities</i> is at the end of the stream. If the caller uses a memory stream for <i>pCapabilities</i>, such as a stream created by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-createstreamonhglobal">CreateStreamOnHGlobal</a> , the caller is responsible for resetting the seek position before reading the data.

If <i>pbstrErrorMessage</i> is not <b>NULL</b> when the function returns, the caller must free the string with <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oleauto/nf-oleauto-sysfreestring">SysFreeString</a>.
