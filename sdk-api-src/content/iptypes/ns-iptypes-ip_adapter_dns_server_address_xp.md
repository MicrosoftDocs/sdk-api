# IP_ADAPTER_DNS_SERVER_ADDRESS_XP structure


## -description


The 
<b>IP_ADAPTER_DNS_SERVER_ADDRESS</b> structure stores a single DNS server address in a linked list of DNS server addresses for a particular adapter.


## -struct-fields




### -field Alignment

Reserved. Used by the compiler to align the structure.


### -field Length

The length, in bytes, of this structure.


### -field Reserved

Reserved. 
							


### -field Next

A pointer to the next DNS server address structure in the list.


### -field Address

The IP address for this DNS server entry. This member can be an IPv6 address or an IPv4 address. 


## -remarks



The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/iptypes/ns-iptypes-ip_adapter_addresses_lh">IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES</a> structure is retrieved by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/iphlpapi/nf-iphlpapi-getadaptersaddresses">GetAdaptersAddresses</a> function. The <b>FirstDnsServerAddress</b> member of the <b>IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES</b>structure is a pointer to a linked list of <b>IP_ADAPTER_DNS_SERVER_ADDRESS</b> structures. 

The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ws2def/ns-ws2def-socket_address">SOCKET_ADDRESS</a> structure is used in the <b>IP_ADAPTER_DNS_SERVER_ADDRESS</b> structure. On the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) released for Windows Vista and later, the organization of header files has changed and the <b>SOCKET_ADDRESS</b> structure is defined in the <i>Ws2def.h</i> header file which is automatically included by the <i>Winsock2.h</i> header file. On the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) released for Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP, the <b>SOCKET_ADDRESS</b> structure is declared in the <i>Winsock2.h</i> header file. In order to use the <b>IP_ADAPTER_DNS_SERVER_ADDRESS</b> structure, the <i>Winsock2.h</i> header file must be included before the <i>Iphlpapi.h</i> header file.
