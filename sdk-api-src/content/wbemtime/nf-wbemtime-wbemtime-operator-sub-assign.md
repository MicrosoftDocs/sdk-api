    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/wmi_v2/windows-management-infrastructure">MI APIs</a> should be used for all new 
    development.]

The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/wbemtime">WBEMTime</a> class subtract-and-assign (–=) operator has been overloaded to decrement an object's time by a time span.
