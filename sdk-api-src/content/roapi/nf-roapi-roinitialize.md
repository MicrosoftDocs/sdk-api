The concurrency model for the thread. The default is <b>RO_INIT_MULTITHREADED</b>.

</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The Windows Runtime was initialized successfully on this thread.

</td>

<tr>
<td width="40%">

<td width="60%">
The Windows Runtime is already initialized on this thread.

</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
A previous call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/roapi/nf-roapi-roinitialize">RoInitialize</a> specified the concurrency model for this thread as multithread apartment (MTA). This could also indicate that a change from neutral-threaded apartment to single-threaded apartment has occurred.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## -remarks

Use the <b>RoInitialize</b> function to initialize a thread in the Windows Runtime. All threads that activate and interact with Windows Runtime objects must be initialized prior to calling into the Windows Runtime. 

Call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/roapi/nf-roapi-rouninitialize">RoUninitialize</a> function to close the Windows Runtime on the current thread. Each successful call to <b>RoInitialize</b>, including those that return <b>S_FALSE</b>, must be balanced by a corresponding call to <b>RoUninitialize</b>.
