## -remarks



To retrieve the ARP table, call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/iphlpapi/nf-iphlpapi-getipnettable">GetIpNetTable</a> function. 

On Windows Vista and later, the <b>DeleteProxyArpEntry</b> function can only be called by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group. If <b>DeleteProxyArpEntry</b> is called by a user that is not a member of the Administrators group, the function call will fail and <b>ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED</b> is returned. This function can also fail because of user account control (UAC) on Windows Vista and later. If an application that contains this function is executed by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator, this call will fail unless the application has been marked in the manifest file with a <b>requestedExecutionLevel</b> set to requireAdministrator. If the application on Windows Vista and later lacks this manifest file, a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator must then be executing the application in an enhanced shell as the built-in Administrator (RunAs administrator) for this function to succeed.



<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This function executes a privileged operation. For this function to execute successfully, the caller must be logged on as a member of the Administrators group or the NetworkConfigurationOperators group.</div>
<div> </div>
