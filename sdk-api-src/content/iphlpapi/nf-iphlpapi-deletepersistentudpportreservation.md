## -remarks



The <b>DeletePersistentUdpPortReservation</b> function is defined on Windows Vista and later. 

The <b>DeletePersistentUdpPortReservation</b> function is used to delete a persistent reservation for a block of UDP ports. 

The <b>DeletePersistentUdpPortReservation</b> function can only be called by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group. If <b>DeletePersistentUdpPortReservation</b> is called by a user that is not a member of the Administrators group, the function call will fail and <b>ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED</b> is returned. This function can also fail because of user account control (UAC) on Windows Vista and later. If an application that contains this function is executed by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator, this call will fail unless the application has been marked in the manifest file with a <b>requestedExecutionLevel</b> set to requireAdministrator. If the application lacks this manifest file, a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator must then be executing the application in an enhanced shell as the built-in Administrator (RunAs administrator) for this function to succeed.
