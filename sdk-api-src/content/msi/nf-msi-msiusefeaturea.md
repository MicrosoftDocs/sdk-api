## -remarks

The 
<b>MsiUseFeature</b> function should only be used on features known to be published. INSTALLSTATE_UNKNOWN indicates that the program is trying to use a feature that is not published. The application should determine whether the feature is published before calling 
<b>MsiUseFeature</b> by calling 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/msi/nf-msi-msiqueryfeaturestatea">MsiQueryFeatureState</a> or 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/msi/nf-msi-msienumfeaturesa">MsiEnumFeatures</a>. The application should make these calls while it initializes. An application should only use features that are known to be published.





> [!NOTE]
> The msi.h header defines MsiUseFeature as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
