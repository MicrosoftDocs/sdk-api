## -remarks



The 
<b>MsiUseFeatureEx</b> function should only be used on features known to be published. INSTALLSTATE_UNKNOWN indicates that the program is trying to use a feature that is not published. The application should determine whether the feature is published before calling 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/msi/nf-msi-msiusefeaturea">MsiUseFeature</a> by calling 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/msi/nf-msi-msiqueryfeaturestatea">MsiQueryFeatureState</a> or 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/msi/nf-msi-msienumfeaturesa">MsiEnumFeatures</a>. The application should make these calls while it initializes. An application should only use features that are known to be published.
