# IWSDTransportAddress::GetTransportAddressEx


## -description


Gets a pointer to a string representation of the address object.  The format of the string varies, and is determined by the implementing interface (either <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wsdbase/nn-wsdbase-iwsdhttpaddress">IWSDHttpAddress</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wsdbase/nn-wsdbase-iwsdudpaddress">IWSDUdpAddress</a>).


## -parameters




### -param fSafe [in]

Specifies whether the scope identifier for an IPv6 address is included in the returned <i>ppszAddress</i> string. For example, if the address object represents an IPv6 link local address and <i>fSafe</i> is <b>FALSE</b>, then the IPv6 scope identifier will be included in the returned <i>ppszAddress</i> string.

If the address object represents an IPv4 address or a host name, this parameter is ignored.


### -param ppszAddress [out]

String representation of the address object. Do not deallocate this pointer.


## -returns



This method can return one of these values.


Possible return values include, but are not limited to, the following.

The transport address has not yet been set. To set the transport address, call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wsdbase/nf-wsdbase-iwsdtransportaddress-settransportaddress">SetTransportAddress</a> with a non-<b>NULL</b> address.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



The string returned by this method may contain an IPv4 or unbracketed IPv6 address such as "fe80::1".  It may also contain a bracketed IPv6 address that includes the port such as "[fe80::1]:1234".  The caller should parse the string carefully to account for both possibilities.
