# IWSDTransportAddress::GetTransportAddress


## -description

Gets a pointer to a string representation of the address object.  The format of the string varies, and is determined by the implementing interface (either <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wsdbase/nn-wsdbase-iwsdhttpaddress">IWSDHttpAddress</a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wsdbase/nn-wsdbase-iwsdudpaddress">IWSDUdpAddress</a>).

## -parameters

### -param ppszAddress [out]

String representation of the address object. Do not deallocate this pointer.

## -returns

This method can return one of these values.


Possible return values include, but are not limited to, the following.

The transport address has not yet been set. To set the transport address, call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wsdbase/nf-wsdbase-iwsdtransportaddress-settransportaddress">SetTransportAddress</a> with a non-<b>NULL</b> address.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## -remarks

The string returned by this method may contain an IPv4 or unbracketed IPv6 address such as "fe80::1".  It may also contain a bracketed IPv6 address that includes the port such as "[fe80::1]:1234".  The caller should parse the string carefully to account for both possibilities.
