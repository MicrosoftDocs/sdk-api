The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vdslun/ns-vdslun-vds_interconnect">VDS_INTERCONNECT</a> structure includes a <b>VDS_INTERCONNECT_ADDRESS_TYPE</b> value as a member to indicate an interconnect address type.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Additional constants might be added to the <b>VDS_INTERCONNECT_ADDRESS_TYPE</b> enumeration in future Windows versions. For this reason, your application must be designed to gracefully handle an unrecognized <b>VDS_INTERCONNECT_ADDRESS_TYPE</b> enumeration constant.</div>
