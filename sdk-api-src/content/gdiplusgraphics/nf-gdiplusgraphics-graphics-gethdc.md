# Graphics::GetHDC


## -description


The <b>Graphics::GetHDC</b> method gets a handle to the device context associated with this 
			<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusgraphics/nl-gdiplusgraphics-graphics">Graphics</a> object.


## -parameters






## -returns



Type: <b>HDC</b>

This method returns a handle to the device context associated with this 
						<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusgraphics/nl-gdiplusgraphics-graphics">Graphics</a> object.




## -remarks



Each call to the <b>Graphics::GetHDC</b> method of a 
				<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusgraphics/nl-gdiplusgraphics-graphics">Graphics</a> object should be paired with a call 
to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusgraphics/nf-gdiplusgraphics-graphics-releasehdc">Graphics::ReleaseHDC</a> method of that same 
				<b>Graphics</b> object. Do not call any methods of the 
				<b>Graphics</b> object between the calls to <b>Graphics::GetHDC</b> and <b>Graphics::ReleaseHDC</b>. If you attempt to call a method of the 
				<b>Graphics</b> object between <b>Graphics::GetHDC</b> and <b>Graphics::ReleaseHDC</b>, the method will fail and will return ObjectBusy. 

Any state changes you make to the device context between <b>Graphics::GetHDC</b> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusgraphics/nf-gdiplusgraphics-graphics-releasehdc">Graphics::ReleaseHDC</a> will be ignored by GDI+ and will not be reflected in rendering done by GDI+.


#### Examples



The following function uses GDI+ to draw an ellipse, then uses GDI to draw a rectangle, and finally uses GDI+ to draw a line. The function's one parameter is a pointer to a GDI+ 
						<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusgraphics/nl-gdiplusgraphics-graphics">Graphics</a> object. The code calls the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/ms536067(v=vs.85)">Graphics::DrawEllipse</a> method of that 
						<b>Graphics</b> object to draw an ellipse. Next, the code calls the <b>Graphics::GetHDC</b> method to obtain a handle to the device context associated with the 
						<b>Graphics</b> object. The code draws a rectangle by passing the device context handle to the GDI<b>Rectangle</b> function. The code calls the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusgraphics/nf-gdiplusgraphics-graphics-releasehdc">Graphics::ReleaseHDC</a> method of the 
						<b>Graphics</b> object and then uses the 
						<b>Graphics</b> object to draw a line.


```cpp
VOID Example_GetReleaseHDC(Graphics* g)
{
   Pen pen(Color(255, 0, 0, 255));
   g->DrawEllipse(&pen, 10, 10, 100, 50);  // GDI+
   
   HDC hdc = g->GetHDC();
   
      // Make GDI calls, but don't call any methods
      // on g until after the call to ReleaseHDC.
      Rectangle(hdc, 120, 10, 220, 60);  // GDI  
   g->ReleaseHDC(hdc);
   
   // Ok to call methods on g again.
   g->DrawLine(&pen, 240, 10, 340, 60);  
}
```
