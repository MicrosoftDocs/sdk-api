# Graphics::BeginContainer


## -description

The <b>Graphics::BeginContainer</b> method begins a new graphics container.

## -parameters

### -param dstrect

Reference to a rectangle that, together with *srcrect*, specifies a transformation for the container.

### -param srcrect

Reference to a rectangle that, together with *dstrect*, specifies a transformation for the container.

### -param unit

Unit of measure for the container.

## -returns

Type: Type: <b>GraphicsContainer</b>

This method returns a value that identifies the container.

## -remarks

Use this method to create nested graphics containers. 
Graphics containers are used to retain graphics state, such as transformations, clipping regions, and various rendering properties.

The **Graphics::BeginContainer** method returns a value of type **GraphicsContainer**.
When you have finished using a container, pass that value to the **Graphics::EndContainer** method.
The **GraphicsContainer** data type is defined in Gdiplusenums.h.

The *dstrect* and *srcrect* parameters specify a transformation.
It is the transformation that, when applied to *srcrect*, results in *dstrect*.

When you call the **Graphics::BeginContainer** method of a **Graphics** object, an information block that holds the state of the **Graphics** object is put on a stack.
The **Graphics::BeginContainer** method returns a value that identifies that information block.
When you pass the identifying value to the **Graphics::EndContainer** method, the information block is removed from the stack and is used to restore the **Graphics** object to the state it was in at the time of the **Graphics::BeginContainer** call.

Containers can be nested; that is, you can call the **Graphics::BeginContainer** method several times before you call the **Graphics::EndContainer** method.
Each time you call the **Graphics::BeginContainer** method, an information block is put on the stack, and you receive an identifier for the information block. 
When you pass one of those identifiers to the Graphics::EndContainer method, the **Graphics** object is returned to the state it was in at the time of the **BeginContainer** call that returned that particular identifier.
The information block placed on the stack by that **Graphics::BeginContainer** call is removed from the stack, and all information blocks placed on that stack after that **Graphics::BeginContainer** call are also removed.

Calls to the **Graphics::Save** method place information blocks on the same stack as calls to the **Graphics::BeginContainer** method.
Just as an **Graphics::EndContainer** call is paired with a **Graphics::BeginContainer** call, a **Graphics::Restore** call is paired with a **Graphics::Save** call.

<div class="alert"><b>Caution</b> </div>

When you call **Graphics::EndContainer**, all information blocks placed on the stack (by **Graphics::Save** or by **Graphics::BeginContainer**) after the corresponding call to **Graphics::BeginContainer** are removed from the stack.
Likewise, when you call **Graphics::Restore**, all information blocks placed on the stack (by **Graphics::Save** or by **Graphics::BeginContainer**) after the corresponding call to **Graphics::Save** are removed from the stack.

#### Examples

The following example calls the **BeginContainer** method to create a graphics container.
The code specifies a transformation for the container by passing two rectangles to the **BeginContainer** method.
The code calls **Graphics::FillEllipse** twice: once inside the container and once outside the container (after the call to **Graphics::EndContainer**).

```cpp
VOID Example_BeginContainer3(HDC hdc)
{
   Graphics graphics(hdc);

   // Define a translation and scale transform for the container.
   RectF srcRect(0, 0, 200, 100);
   RectF destRect(100, 100, 200, 200);

   // Create a graphics container with a (100, 100) translation
   // and (1, 2) scale.
   GraphicsContainer container;
   container = graphics.BeginContainer(destRect, srcRect, UnitPixel);

   // Fill a rectangle in the container.
   SolidBrush redBrush(Color(255, 255, 0, 0));
   graphics.FillEllipse(&amp;redBrush, 0, 0, 100, 60);

   // End the container.
   graphics.EndContainer(container);

   // Fill a rectangle outside the container.
   SolidBrush blueBrush(Color(255, 0, 0, 255));
   graphics.FillEllipse(&amp;blueBrush, 0, 0, 100, 60);
```
