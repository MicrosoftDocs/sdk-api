# ITSGAuthorizeConnectionSink interface


## -description

Exposes methods that notify Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway) about the result of an  attempt to authorize a connection. The authorization plug-in should not implement this interface because it is already implemented. A pointer to this interface is passed to the authorization plug-in when RD Gateway calls the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/tsgpolicyengine/nf-tsgpolicyengine-itsgpolicyengine-authorizeconnection">AuthorizeConnection</a> method.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">ITSGAuthorizeConnectionSink</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>ITSGAuthorizeConnectionSink</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>
