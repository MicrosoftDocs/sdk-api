# ITSGAccountingEngine interface


## -description


Exposes  methods that provide information about the creation or closing of sessions for a connection. Implement this interface when you want to receive this information from Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway).


## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">ITSGAccountingEngine</b> interface inherits from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>ITSGAccountingEngine</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -members

The <b>ITSGAccountingEngine</b> interface has these methods.
<table class="members" id="memberListMethods">
<tr>
<th align="left" width="37%">Method</th>
<th align="left" width="63%">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr data="declared;">
<td align="left" width="37%">
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tsgpolicyengine/nf-tsgpolicyengine-itsgaccountingengine-doaccounting">DoAccounting</a>
</td>
<td align="left" width="63%">
Provides information about the creation or closing of sessions for a connection.

</td>
</tr>
</table> 


## -remarks



Your authorization plug-in can use this interface to retrieve useful information about clients, client  computers, and remote sessions. For example, your plug-in can track the amount of time that a client is connected and the amount of data transferred during that session.
