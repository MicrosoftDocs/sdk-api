# ITSGAuthorizeConnectionSink::OnConnectionAuthorized


## -description


Notifies Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway) about the result of an  attempt to authorize a connection.


## -parameters




### -param hrIn [in]

The result of the authorization attempt. Specify <b>S_OK</b> to indicate that the attempt succeeded. Specify any other value to indicate that the attempt failed.


### -param mainSessionId [in]

A unique identifier assigned to the connection request by RD Gateway.


### -param cbSoHResponse [in]

The number of bytes referenced by the  <i>pbSoHResponse</i> parameter.


### -param pbSoHResponse [in]

A pointer to a <b>BYTE</b> that specifies the response to the request for a statement of health (SoH). If the <i>hrIn</i> parameter is not <b>S_OK</b>, this parameter is ignored.


### -param idleTimeout [in]

The number of minutes that the connection can remain idle before being disconnected. If the <i>hrIn</i> parameter is not <b>S_OK</b>, this parameter is ignored.


### -param sessionTimeout [in]

 The maximum number of minutes allotted to the session. If the <i>hrIn</i> parameter is not <b>S_OK</b>, this parameter is ignored.


### -param sessionTimeoutAction [in]

The action to be taken when the session times out. If the <i>hrIn</i> parameter is not <b>S_OK</b>, this parameter is ignored. This parameter can be one of the following values.



#### SESSION_TIMEOUT_ACTION_DISCONNECT

Disconnect the session.



#### SESSION_TIMEOUT_ACTION_SILENT_REAUTH

Silently reauthenticate and reauthorize the session.


### -param trustClass [in]

This parameter is reserved. Always set it to  <b>AA_TRUSTEDUSER_TRUSTEDCLIENT</b>. If the <i>hrIn</i> parameter is not <b>S_OK</b>, this parameter is ignored.


### -param policyAttributes [in]

An array of Boolean values  that specify the redirection settings associated with the connection. Each element of the array corresponds to a value of the <a href="/windows/win32/api/tsgpolicyengine/ne-tsgpolicyengine-policyattributetype">PolicyAttributeType</a> enumeration. If the <i>hrIn</i> parameter is not <b>S_OK</b>, this parameter is ignored.


## -returns



If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



You can call this method from your implementation of 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tsgpolicyengine/nf-tsgpolicyengine-itsgpolicyengine-authorizeconnection">AuthorizeConnection</a>. If 
    authentication requires more than 1 second, we recommend launching a separate thread to perform 
    authentication.


#### Examples

For an example that uses the 
     <b>OnConnectionAuthorized</b> method, see 
     <a href="https://Code.MSDN.Microsoft.Com/Remote-Desktop-Gateway-517d6273">Remote Desktop Gateway Pluggable Authentication and Authorization Sample</a>.
