# IsNetworkAlive function


## -description


The 
<b>IsNetworkAlive</b> function determines whether or not a   local system is connected to a network, and identifies the type of network connection, for example, a LAN, WAN, or both.


## -parameters




### -param lpdwFlags [out]

The type of network connection that is available. This parameter can be one of the following values: 







#### NETWORK_ALIVE_LAN

The computer has one or more LAN cards that are active.



#### NETWORK_ALIVE_WAN

The computer has one or more active RAS connections.


## -returns



Always call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a> before checking the return code of this function.  If the last error is not 0, the <b>IsNetworkAlive</b> function has failed and the following <b>TRUE</b> and <b>FALSE</b> values do not apply.

<th>Description</th>

<dt><b>TRUE</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
If the last error is 0 and the function returns <b>TRUE</b>, SENS has determined that a  local system is connected to a network. 

For information about the type of connection, see the <i>lpdwFlags</i> parameter.

<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>

</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
If the last error is 0 and the function returns <b>FALSE</b>, SENS has determined there is no connection. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



Starting with applications designed for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, developers should consider using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/NLA/portal">Network List Manager</a> instead of this function.

This function can be used by an application to determine whether or not there is network connectivity before proceeding with network operations. A directory service type of application, e-mail client, or Internet browser can adapt to various types of network connectivity. For example, a printing operation can be deferred until a network connection is available.

It may not always be practical for an application to call 
<b>IsNetworkAlive</b> to determine whether or not a  local system is disconnected from a LAN, because <b>IsNetworkAlive</b> can be slow, and it may take too much time for the function to detect that a local system is disconnected. 
However, <b>IsNetworkAlive</b> can always identify a WAN connectivity at the moment.
