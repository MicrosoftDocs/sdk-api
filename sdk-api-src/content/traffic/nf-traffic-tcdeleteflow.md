# TcDeleteFlow function


## -description


The 
<b>TcDeleteFlow</b> function deletes a flow that has been added with the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/traffic/nf-traffic-tcaddflow">TcAddFlow</a> function. Clients should delete all filters associated with a flow before deleting it, otherwise, an error will be returned and the function will not delete the flow.

Traffic control clients that have registered a <b>DeleteFlowComplete</b> handler (a mechanism for allowing traffic control to call the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/traffic/nc-traffic-tci_del_flow_complete_handler">ClDeleteFlowComplete</a> callback function to alert clients of completed flow deletions) can expect a return value of ERROR_SIGNAL_PENDING.


## -parameters




### -param FlowHandle [in]

Handle for the flow, as received from a previous call to the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/traffic/nf-traffic-tcaddflow">TcAddFlow</a> function.


## -returns

<th>Description</th>

<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/traffic/nc-traffic-tci_del_flow_complete_handler">ClDeleteFlowComplete</a> function when the flow has been added, or when the process has been completed.

## -remarks



If the 
<b>TcDeleteFlow</b> function returns ERROR_SIGNAL_PENDING, the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/traffic/nc-traffic-tci_del_flow_complete_handler">ClDeleteFlowComplete</a> function will be called on a different thread than the thread that called the 
<b>TcDeleteFlow</b> function.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Use of the 
<b>TcDeleteFlow</b> function requires administrative privilege.</div>
<div> </div>
