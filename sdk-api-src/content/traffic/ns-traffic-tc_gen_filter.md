# TC_GEN_FILTER structure


## -description


The 
<b>TC_GEN_FILTER</b> structure creates a filter that matches a certain set of packet attributes or criteria, which can subsequently be used to associate packets that meet the attribute criteria with a particular flow. The 
<b>TC_GEN_FILTER</b> structure uses its <b>AddressType</b> member to indicate a specific filter type to apply to the filter.


## -struct-fields




### -field AddressType

Defines the filter type to be applied with the filter, as defined in Ntddndis.h. With the designation of a specific filter in <b>AddressType</b>, the generic filter structure 
<b>TC_GEN_FILTER</b> provides a specific filter type.


### -field PatternSize

Size of the <b>Pattern</b> member, in bytes.


### -field Pattern

Indicates the specific format of the pattern to be applied to the filter, such as 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/traffic/ns-traffic-ip_pattern">IP_PATTERN</a>. The pattern specifies which bits of a given packet should be evaluated when determining whether a packet is included in the filter.


### -field Mask

A bitmask applied to the bits designated in the <b>Pattern</b> member. The application of the <b>Mask</b> member to the <b>Pattern</b> member determines which bits in the <b>Pattern</b> member are significant (should be applied to the filter criteria). Note that the <b>Mask</b> member must be of the same type as the <b>Pattern</b> member.
