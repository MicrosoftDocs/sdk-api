# WinUsb_ReadIsochPipeAsap function


## -description


The <b>WinUsb_ReadIsochPipeAsap</b> function submits a request that reads data from an isochronous OUT endpoint.  


## -parameters




### -param BufferHandle [in]

An opaque handle to the transfer buffer that was registered by a previous call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn265566">WinUsb_RegisterIsochBuffer</a>. 


### -param Offset [in]

Offset into the buffer relative to the start the transfer.


### -param Length [in]

Length in bytes of the transfer buffer.


### -param ContinueStream [in]

Indicates that the transfer  should only be submitted if it can be scheduled in the first frame after the last pending transfer. 


### -param NumberOfPackets [in]

Total number of isochronous packets required to hold the transfer buffer. Also indicates the number of elements in the array pointed to by <i>IsoPacketDescriptors</i>.


### -param IsoPacketDescriptors

An array of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff539084">USBD_ISO_PACKET_DESCRIPTOR</a> that receives the details of each isochronous packet in the transfer. 


### -param Overlapped [in, optional]

Pointer to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2b5964e5-dfc8-44f9-86a7-5ea5acc68c1b">OVERLAPPED</a> structure used for asynchronous operations.


## -returns



<b>WinUsb_ReadIsochPipeAsap</b> returns TRUE if the operation succeeds.  Otherwise this function returns FALSE, and the caller can retrieve the logged error by calling <b>GetLastError</b>.

If the caller sets <i>ContinueStream</i> to TRUE, The transfer fails if Winusb.sys is unable to schedule the transfer to continue the stream without dropping one or more frames.




## -remarks



<b>WinUsb_ReadIsochPipeAsap</b> allows the USB driver stack to choose the starting frame number for the transfer.  If one or more transfers are already pending on the endpoint, the transfer will be scheduled for the frame number immediately following the last frame number of the last currently pending transfer.


<b>WinUsb_ReadIsochPipeAsap</b> packetizes the transfer buffer so that in each interval,  the host can send the maximum bytes allowed per interval. The maximum bytes is as specified by the endpoint descriptor for full and high-speed endpoints, and endpoint companion descriptor for SuperSpeed endpoints.
If the caller submits multiple write requests to stream data to the device, the transfer size should be a multiple of the maximum bytes per interval (as returned by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn265563">WinUsb_QueryPipeEx</a>) * 8 / interval.
