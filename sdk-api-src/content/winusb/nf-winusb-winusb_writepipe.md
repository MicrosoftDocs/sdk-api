# WinUsb_WritePipe function


## -description


The <b>WinUsb_WritePipe</b> function writes data to a pipe.


## -parameters




### -param InterfaceHandle [in]

An opaque handle to the interface that contains the endpoint with which the pipe is associated. 

To write to  a pipe that is associated with an endpoint in the first interface, use the handle returned by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winusb/nf-winusb-winusb_initialize">WinUsb_Initialize</a>. For all other interfaces, use the handle to the target interface, retrieved by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winusb/nf-winusb-winusb_getassociatedinterface">WinUsb_GetAssociatedInterface</a>.


### -param PipeID [in]

<i>PipeID</i> corresponds to the <b>bEndpointAddress</b> field in the endpoint descriptor. For information about the layout of this field, see <b>Table 9-13</b> in "Universal Serial Bus Specification Revision 2.0" at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/whdc/connect/usb/default.mspx">USB Technology</a>. In the <b>bEndpointAddress</b> field, Bit 7 indicates the direction of the endpoint: 0 for OUT; 1 for IN.


### -param Buffer [in]

A caller-allocated buffer that contains the data to write.


### -param BufferLength [in]

The number of bytes to write. This number must be less than or equal to the size, in bytes, of <i>Buffer</i>.


### -param LengthTransferred [out, optional]

A pointer to a ULONG variable that receives the actual number of bytes that were written to the pipe. For more information, see Remarks.


### -param Overlapped [in, optional]

An optional pointer to an OVERLAPPED structure, which is used for asynchronous operations. If this parameter is specified, <b>WinUsb_WritePipe</b> immediately returns, and the event is signaled when the operation is complete.


## -returns



<b>WinUsb_WritePipe</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this function returns <b>FALSE</b>, and the caller can retrieve the logged error by calling <b>GetLastError</b>.


<b>GetLastError</b>    can return the following error code.

If the overlapped operation cannot be completed immediately, the function returns <b>FALSE</b> and the <b>GetLastError</b> function returns ERROR_IO_PENDING, indicating that the operation is executing in the background. Call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winusb/nf-winusb-winusb_getoverlappedresult">WinUsb_GetOverlappedResult</a> to check the success or failure of the operation.

</td>
<td width="60%">
The write operation initiated by  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winusb/nf-winusb-winusb_writepipe">WinUsb_WritePipe</a> in the USB stack timed out before the operation could be completed.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



To create a write request, your the application must allocate a buffer, fill it with the data that you want to write to the device, and send the buffer to the host controller by calling  <b>WinUsb_WritePipe</b>. 

The following restrictions apply to the size of the buffer if  RAW_IO is  set:

<ul>
<li>The buffer length must be a multiple of the maximum endpoint packet size.</li>
<li>The length must be less than or equal to the value of MAXIMUM_TRANSFER_SIZE retrieved by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winusb/nf-winusb-winusb_getpipepolicy">WinUsb_GetPipePolicy</a>.</li>
</ul>
There are no restrictions on the size of the buffer if RAW_IO is not set as the pipe's policy type. If the size of the buffer is greater than the maximum transfer length reported by MAXIMUM_TRANSFER_SIZE, WinUSB divides the request into smaller requests and submits them serially to the host controller.

A write request that contains zero-length data is forwarded down the USB stack. 

If an application passes <b>NULL</b> in the <i>Overlapped</i> parameter (synchronous operation), it must ensure that <i>LengthTransferred</i> is not <b>NULL</b>, even when an operation produces no output data.

If <i>Overlapped</i> is not <b>NULL</b> (asynchronous operation),  <i>LengthTransferred</i> can be set to <b>NULL</b>. For an overlapped operation (and if <i>LengthTransferred</i> is a non-<b>NULL</b> value), the value received in <i>LengthTransferred</i> after <b>WinUsb_WritePipe</b> returns is meaningless until the overlapped operation has completed. To retrieve the actual number of bytes returned, call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winusb/nf-winusb-winusb_getoverlappedresult">WinUsb_GetOverlappedResult</a>.
