# ICertEncodeDateArray interface


## -description

The <b>ICertEncodeDateArray</b> interface provides methods for handling <b>Date</b> arrays used in certificate extensions.

 A certificate extension can be created by using a <b>Date</b> array stored in an 
<a href="/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/writing-custom-extension-handlers">extension handler</a> COM object instantiated by the policy module. Each element in the array is a <b>Date</b> value.

This interface is provided mainly as a demonstration for encoding custom extensions. The Certificate Services sample programs in the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) contain source code for this interface.

<b>ICertEncodeDateArray</b> is defined in Certenc.h. When you create your program, however, use Certsrv.h as the include file. Certenc.dll provides the <b>ICertEncodeDateArray</b> interface. The type information for this interface is also in Certencl.dll, which is shipped with the Platform SDK.

Certificate Services interfaces support both apartment-threading and free-threading models. For better throughput, free threading is recommended.

## -inheritance

The <b>ICertEncodeDateArray</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oaidl/nn-oaidl-idispatch">IDispatch</a> interface. <b>ICertEncodeDateArray</b> also has these types of members:
