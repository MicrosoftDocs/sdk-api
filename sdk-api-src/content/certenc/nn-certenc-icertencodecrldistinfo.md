# ICertEncodeCRLDistInfo interface


## -description

The <b>ICertEncodeCRLDistInfo</b> interface provides methods for handling <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">certificate revocation list</a> (CRL) distribution information arrays used in certificate extensions.

 A certificate extension can be created by using a CRL distribution information array stored in an 
<a href="/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/writing-custom-extension-handlers">extension handler</a> COM object instantiated by the policy module. Each element in the array is a CRL distribution point structure that contains an array of names and name choices. This interface is useful for encoding and decoding szOID_CRL_DIST_POINTS "2.5.29.31" extensions; the SDK sample policy module uses this interface.

<b>ICertEncodeCRLDistInfo</b> is defined in Certenc.h. When you create your program, however, use Certsrv.h as the include file. Certenc.dll provides the <b>ICertEncodeCRLDistInfo</b> interface. The type information for this interface is also in Certencl.dll, which is shipped with the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK).

Certificate Services interfaces support both apartment-threading and free-threading models. For better throughput, free threading is recommended.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">ICertEncodeCRLDistInfo</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oaidl/nn-oaidl-idispatch">IDispatch</a> interface. <b>ICertEncodeCRLDistInfo</b> also has these types of members:
