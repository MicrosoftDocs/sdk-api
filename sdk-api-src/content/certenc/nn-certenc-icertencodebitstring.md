# ICertEncodeBitString interface


## -description

The <b>ICertEncodeBitString</b> interface provides methods for handling bit strings used in certificate extensions. A certificate extension can be created by using a bit string stored in an 
<a href="/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/writing-custom-extension-handlers">extension handler</a> COM object instantiated by the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/policy-modules">policy module</a>. The bit string can contain an arbitrary string of binary values. This interface is useful for encoding and decoding szOID_KEY_USAGE "2.5.29.15" extensions; the SDK sample policy module uses this interface.

<b>ICertEncodeBitString</b> is defined in Certenc.h. When you create your program, however, use Certsrv.h as the include file. Certenc.dll provides the <b>ICertEncodeBitString</b> interface. The type information for this interface is also in Certencl.dll, which is shipped with the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK).

Certificate Services interfaces support both apartment-threading and free-threading models. For better throughput, free threading is recommended.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">ICertEncodeBitString</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oaidl/nn-oaidl-idispatch">IDispatch</a> interface. <b>ICertEncodeBitString</b> also has these types of members:
