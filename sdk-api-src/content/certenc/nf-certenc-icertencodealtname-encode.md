# ICertEncodeAltName::Encode


## -description


The <b>Encode</b> method returns an ASN.1-encoded string of the alternate name array stored in this object. The names in the object are not encoded.

Use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/certenc/nf-certenc-icertencodealtname-decode">Decode</a> method to decode the encoded string into an <b>CertEncodeAltName</b> object.

Before using this method, you must call both the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/certenc/nf-certenc-icertencodealtname-reset">Reset</a> method to size the array and the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/certenc/nf-certenc-icertencodealtname-setnameentry">SetNameEntry</a> method to set each array element.


## -parameters




### -param pstrBinary [out]

A pointer to a <b>BSTR</b> that receives the ASN.1-encoded alternate name extension. When done, call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oleauto/nf-oleauto-sysfreestring">SysFreeString</a> to free <i>pbstrBinary</i>.


## -returns



<h3>C++</h3>
 If the method succeeds, the method returns S_OK.

If the method fails, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value that indicates the error. For a list of common error codes, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/common-hresult-values">Common HRESULT Values</a>.

<h3>VB</h3>
 The return value is the ASN.1-encoded alternate name array.
