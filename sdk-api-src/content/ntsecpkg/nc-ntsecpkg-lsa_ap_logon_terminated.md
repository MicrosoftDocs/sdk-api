# LSA_AP_LOGON_TERMINATED callback function


## -description


Used to notify an authentication package when a logon session terminates.
			A logon session terminates when the last token referencing the logon session is deleted.


## -parameters




### -param LogonId [in]

Pointer to the logon ID of the session that just ended.


## -remarks



When <b>LsaApLogonTerminated</b> is called, an authentication package should release any resources held for the logon ID, such as credentials created within the LSA. The LSA does not automatically perform this cleanup.
