# CancelIoEx function


## -description


Marks any outstanding I/O operations for the specified file handle. The function only cancels I/O 
    operations in the current process, regardless of which thread created the I/O operation.


## -parameters




### -param hFile [in]

A handle to the file.


### -param lpOverlapped [in, optional]

A pointer to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-overlapped">OVERLAPPED</a> data structure that 
       contains the data used for asynchronous  I/O.

If this parameter is <b>NULL</b>, all I/O requests for the <i>hFile</i> 
       parameter are canceled.

If this parameter is not <b>NULL</b>, only those specific I/O requests that were issued 
       for the file with the specified <i>lpOverlapped</i> overlapped structure are marked as 
       canceled, meaning that you can cancel one or more requests, while the 
       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/cancelio">CancelIo</a> function cancels all outstanding requests on a file 
       handle.


## -returns



If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero. The cancel operation for all pending I/O operations 
       issued by the calling process for the specified file handle was successfully requested. The application must not 
       free or reuse the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-overlapped">OVERLAPPED</a> structure associated with 
       the canceled I/O operations until they have completed. The thread can use the 
       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-getoverlappedresult">GetOverlappedResult</a> function to determine when 
       the I/O operations themselves have been completed.

If the function fails, the return value is 0 (zero). To get extended error information, call the 
       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a> function.

If this function cannot find a request to cancel, the return value is 0 (zero), and 
       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a> returns 
       <b>ERROR_NOT_FOUND</b>.




## -remarks



The <b>CancelIoEx</b> function allows you to cancel 
    requests in threads other than the calling thread. The 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/cancelio">CancelIo</a> function only cancels requests in the same thread that 
    called the <b>CancelIo</b> function. 
    <b>CancelIoEx</b> cancels only outstanding I/O on the handle, 
    it does not change the state of the handle; this means that you cannot rely on the state of the handle because you 
    cannot know whether the operation was completed successfully or canceled.

If there are any pending I/O operations in progress for the specified file handle, the 
    <b>CancelIoEx</b> function marks them for cancellation. Most 
    types of operations can be canceled immediately; other operations can continue toward completion before they are 
    actually canceled and the caller is notified. The 
    <b>CancelIoEx</b> function does not wait for all canceled 
    operations to complete.

If the file handle is associated with a completion port, an I/O completion packet is not queued to the port if 
    a synchronous operation is successfully canceled. For asynchronous operations still pending, the cancel operation 
    will queue an I/O completion packet.

The operation being canceled is completed with one of three statuses; you must check the completion status to 
    determine the completion state. The three statuses are:

<ul>
<li>The operation completed normally. This can occur even if the operation was canceled, because the cancel 
      request might not have been submitted in time to cancel the operation.</li>
<li>The operation was canceled. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a> 
      function returns <b>ERROR_OPERATION_ABORTED</b>.</li>
<li>The operation failed with another error. The 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a> function returns the relevant error 
      code.</li>
</ul>
