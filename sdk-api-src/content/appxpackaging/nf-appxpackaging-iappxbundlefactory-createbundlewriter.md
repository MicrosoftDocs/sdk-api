# IAppxBundleFactory::CreateBundleWriter


## -description


Creates a write-only bundle object to which app packages can be added.  


## -parameters




### -param outputStream [in]

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-istream">IStream</a>*</b>

The output stream that receives the serialized package data. The stream must support at least the  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-isequentialstream-write">Write</a> method.


### -param bundleVersion [in]

Type: <b>UINT64</b>

The version number of the bundle.

 If set to 0, <b>CreateBundleWriter</b> sets the version number of the bundle to a value derived from the current system time.  We recommend passing 0 so version numbers are automatically generated and each successive call generates a higher version number.


For example, if you call <b>CreateBundleWriter</b> on 2013/12/23 3:45:00 AM UTC with <i>bundleVersion</i> set to 0, the version number of the bundle becomes 2013.1223.0345.0000.



### -param bundleWriter [out, retval]

Type: <b>IAppxBundleWriter**</b>

The bundle writer created by this method.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If the method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an error code that includes, but is not limited to, those in the following table. 




## -remarks



Content added to the bundle is serialized out as an Appx bundle file to <i>outputStream</i>.
