## -remarks



When the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/appxpackaging/nf-appxpackaging-iappxpackagewriter-addpayloadfile">AddPayloadFile</a> method succeeds the contents of the specified <i>fileName</i> are written to the package and a corresponding entry is made in the package block map.

<b>AddPayloadPackage</b> reads the content of the app package from <i>packageStream</i> and stores the content in the bundle with the given <i>fileName</i>. 

<b>AddPayloadPackage</b> can fail if:

<ul>
<li><i>packageStream</i> doesn't deliver a valid app package</li>
<li>The app package delivered by <i>packageStream</i> is in a different package family than an app package already added to the bundle</li>
<li>The app package delivered by <i>packageStream</i> is targeted to an architecture that can't reside in the same bundle as another app package already added to the bundle</li>
<li>The app package delivered by <i>packageStream</i> has a block map that uses a different hash method than an app package already added to the bundle</li>
<li><i>fileName</i> isn't a valid file name, is a reserved name, or is already used by another app package added to the bundle</li>
</ul>
