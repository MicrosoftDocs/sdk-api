# NPSearchDialog function


## -description


Enables network vendors to supply their own form of browsing and search, beyond the hierarchical view presented in the <b>Connection</b> dialog box. If a network provider supports this function, the <b>Connection</b> dialog box will enable the <b>Search</b> button when the selected item belongs to that provider. If the user hits the <b>Search</b> button, the <b>Connection</b> dialog box calls <b>NPSearchDialog</b> to handle the user request.


## -parameters




### -param hwndParent [in]

Handle of the window to be used as the parent window of the dialog box.


### -param lpNetResource [in]

Pointer to the currently selected item in the <b>Network Connections</b> dialog box. A provider may choose to ignore this field.


### -param lpBuffer [out]

Pointer to a buffer that will receive the result of the search.


### -param cbBuffer [out]

<b>DWORD</b> that will specify the size of the buffer passed in.


### -param lpnFlags [in]

Pointer to a <b>DWORD</b> of flags that the provider can set to force certain actions after the dialog box is dismissed. The only flag supported is WNSRCH_REFRESH_FIRST_LEVEL, which forces MPR to collapse then expand and refresh the first level below this provider after the dialog box is dismissed.


## -returns



If the function succeeds and the user has clicked <b>OK</b>, <b>NPSearchDialog</b> should return WN_SUCCESS. Otherwise, it should return an error value, which can be one of the following. All other errors should be handled or reported directly by the provider's dialog box.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>WN_CANCEL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The user canceled the operation.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>WN_MORE_DATA</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The input buffer is too small.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



If the provider does not support enumeration, then the action associated with double-clicking the provider's entry will be to invoke its <b>Search</b> dialog box.
