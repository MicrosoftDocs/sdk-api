# NOTIFYCANCEL structure


## -description


The <b>NOTIFYCANCEL</b> structure contains the details of a network disconnect operation. It is used by the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/npapi/nf-npapi-cancelconnectnotify">CancelConnectNotify</a> function.


## -struct-fields




### -field lpName

Pointer to the name of the local device or network resource whose connection is being canceled.


### -field lpProvider

For advance notification, this field is not defined. The MPR will try all valid providers to cancel the connection. 




For after-the-fact notification, if the cancel operation was successful, this field specifies the name of the network provider that canceled the connection.


### -field dwFlags

Currently, the only flag supported is CONNECT_UPDATE_PROFILE, which indicates whether the disconnection should remain persistent. If this flag is set, Windows no longer restores this connection when the user logs on.


### -field fForce

Indicates whether the disconnect should continue even if there are open files or jobs on the connection. If this field is <b>TRUE</b>, the connection is canceled regardless of open files or jobs. If this field is <b>FALSE</b>, the connection will not be canceled if there are open files or jobs.
