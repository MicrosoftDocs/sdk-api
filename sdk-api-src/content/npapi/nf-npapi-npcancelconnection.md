# NPCancelConnection function


## -description

The <b>NPCancelConnection</b> function disconnects a network connection. The changes you make to the connection are remembered if the connection is to a device. If, however, the connection is to a remote network resource, changes are not remembered.

## -parameters

### -param lpName [in]

Pointer to the name of either the redirected local device or the remote network resource to disconnect from.

### -param fForce [in]

Indicates whether the disconnect should continue in the event of open files or jobs on the connection. If <b>FALSE</b> is specified, the call will fail if there are open files or jobs.

## -returns

If the function succeeds, it will return WN_SUCCESS. Otherwise, it will return an error. This can be one of the following.
