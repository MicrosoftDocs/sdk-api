# LinearGradientBrush class


## -description


The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusbrush/nf-gdiplusbrush-lineargradientbrush-lineargradientbrush(constlineargradientbrush_)">LinearGradientBrush</a> class defines a brush that paints a color gradient in which the color changes evenly from the starting boundary line of the linear gradient brush to the ending boundary line of the linear gradient brush. The boundary lines of a linear gradient brush are two parallel straight lines. The color gradient is perpendicular to the boundary lines of the linear gradient brush, changing gradually across the stroke from the starting boundary line to the ending boundary line. The color gradient has one color at the starting boundary line and another color at the ending boundary line.
