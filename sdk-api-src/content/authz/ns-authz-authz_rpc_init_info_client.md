# AUTHZ_RPC_INIT_INFO_CLIENT structure


## -description


The <b>AUTHZ_RPC_INIT_INFO_CLIENT</b> structure initializes a remote resource manager for a client.


## -struct-fields




### -field version

Version of the structure. The highest currently supported version is AUTHZ_RPC_INIT_INFO_CLIENT_VERSION_V1. 


### -field ObjectUuid

Null-terminated string representation of the resource manager UUID. Only the following values are valid.

<ul>
<li>Use “5fc860e0-6f6e-4fc2-83cd-46324f25e90b” for remote effective access evaluation that ignores central policy.</li>
<li>Use “9a81c2bd-a525-471d-a4ed-49907c0b23da” for remote effective access evaluation that takes central policy into account.</li>
</ul>

### -field ProtSeq

Null-terminated string representation of a protocol sequence. This can be the following value.

<ul>
<li>“ncacn_ip_tcp”.</li>
</ul>

### -field NetworkAddr

Null-terminated string representation of a network address. The network-address format is associated with the protocol sequence. 


### -field Endpoint

Null-terminated string representation of an endpoint. The endpoint format and content are associated with the protocol sequence. For example, the endpoint associated with the protocol sequence <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Midl/ncacn-np">ncacn_np</a> is a pipe name in the format <b>\</b><i>Pipe</i><b>\</b><i>PipeName</i>.


### -field Options

Null-terminated string representation of network options. The option string is associated with the protocol sequence.


### -field ServerSpn
