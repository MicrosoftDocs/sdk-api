The <b>AUTHZ_SID_OPERATION</b> enumeration indicates the type of SID operations that can be made by a call to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/authz/nf-authz-authzmodifysids">AuthzModifySids</a> function.

## -enum-fields

### -field AUTHZ_SID_OPERATION_ADD

Adds a new SID. If the SID already exists, the call fails.

### -field AUTHZ_SID_OPERATION_DELETE

Replaces the existing SID with the specified SID. If the SID does not already exist, then adds the SID.
