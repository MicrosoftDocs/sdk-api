# DFS_INFO_101 structure


## -description


Describes the state of storage on a DFS root, link, root target, or link target.


## -struct-fields




### -field State

Specifies a set of bit flags that describe the status of the host server. Following are valid values for this member. Note that the <b>DFS_STORAGE_STATE_OFFLINE</b> and <b>DFS_STORAGE_STATE_ONLINE</b> values are mutually exclusive. 

The storage states can only be set on DFS root targets or DFS link targets. The DFS volume states can only be set on a DFS namespace root or DFS link and not on individual targets.



#### DFS_STORAGE_STATE_OFFLINE (0x00000001)

The DFS storage is offline.



#### DFS_STORAGE_STATE_ONLINE (0x00000002)

The DFS storage is online.



#### DFS_STORAGE_STATE_ACTIVE (0x00000004)

The DFS storage is active. This value is only for use with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/lmdfs/nf-lmdfs-netdfssetclientinfo">NetDfsSetClientInfo</a> function.



#### DFS_VOLUME_STATE_OK (0x00000001)

The specified DFS root or link is in the normal state.



#### DFS_VOLUME_STATE_INCONSISTENT (0x00000002)

The internal DFS database is inconsistent with the specified DFS root or link. Attempts to repair the inconsistency have failed. This value is read-only.



#### DFS_VOLUME_STATE_OFFLINE (0x00000003)

The specified DFS root or link is offline or unavailable.



#### DFS_VOLUME_STATE_ONLINE (0x00000004)

The specified DFS root or link is available.



#### DFS_VOLUME_STATE_RESYNCHRONIZE (0x00000010)

Forces a resynchronization on the DFS root target. This flag is valid only for a DFS root target, and is write-only.



#### DFS_VOLUME_STATE_STANDBY (0x00000020)

Puts a root volume in standby mode. This flag is valid for a clustered DFS namespace only.
