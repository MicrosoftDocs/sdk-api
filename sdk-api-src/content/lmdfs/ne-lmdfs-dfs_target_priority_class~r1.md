# DFS_TARGET_PRIORITY_CLASS enumeration


## -description

Defines the set of possible DFS target priority class settings.


## -enum-fields

### -field DfsInvalidPriorityClass

The priority class is not valid.


### -field DfsSiteCostNormalPriorityClass

The middle or "normal" site cost priority class for a DFS target.


### -field DfsGlobalHighPriorityClass

The highest priority class for a DFS target. Targets assigned this class receive global preference.


### -field DfsSiteCostHighPriorityClass

The highest site cost priority class for a DFS target. Targets assigned this class receive the most preference among targets of the same site cost for a given DFS client.


### -field DfsSiteCostLowPriorityClass

The lowest site cost priority class for a DFS target. Targets assigned this class receive the least preference among targets of the same site cost for a given DFS client.


### -field DfsGlobalLowPriorityClass

The lowest level of priority class for a DFS target. Targets assigned this class receive the least preference globally.


## -remarks



The order of priority classes from highest to lowest is as follows:

<ul>
<li><b>DfsGlobalHighPriorityClass</b></li>
<li><b>DfsSiteCostHighPriorityClass</b></li>
<li><b>DfsSiteCostNormalPriorityClass</b></li>
<li><b>DfsSiteCostLowPriorityClass</b></li>
<li><b>DfsGlobalLowPriorityClass</b></li>
</ul>
Server targets are initially grouped into global high priority, normal priority, and low priority classes. The 
     normal priority class is then subdivided, based on Active Directory site cost, into site-cost high priority, 
     site-cost normal priority, and site-cost low priority classes.

For example, all of the server targets with a site-cost value of 0 are first grouped into site-cost high, 
     normal, and low priority classes. Then, all server targets with lower site costs are likewise separated into 
     site-cost high, normal, and low priority classes. Thus, a server target with a site-cost value of 0 and a 
     site-cost low priority class is still ranked higher than a server target with a site-cost value of 1 and 
     site-cost high priority class.
