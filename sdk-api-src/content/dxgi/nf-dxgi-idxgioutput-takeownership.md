# IDXGIOutput::TakeOwnership


## -description


Takes ownership of an output.


## -parameters




### -param pDevice [in]

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a>*</b>

A pointer to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface of a device (such as an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d10/nn-d3d10-id3d10device">ID3D10Device</a>).


### -param Exclusive

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">BOOL</a></b>

Set to <b>TRUE</b> to enable other threads or applications to take ownership of the device; otherwise, set to <b>FALSE</b>.


## -returns



Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/com/structure-of-com-error-codes">HRESULT</a></b>

Returns one of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3ddxgi/dxgi-error">DXGI_ERROR</a> values.




## -remarks



When you are finished with the output, call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dxgi/nf-dxgi-idxgioutput-releaseownership">IDXGIOutput::ReleaseOwnership</a>.

<b>TakeOwnership</b> should not be called directly by applications, since results will be unpredictable. It is called implicitly by the DXGI swap chain object during full-screen transitions, and should not be used as a substitute for swap-chain methods.

<h3><a id="Notes_for_Windows_Store_apps"></a><a id="notes_for_windows_store_apps"></a><a id="NOTES_FOR_WINDOWS_STORE_APPS"></a>Notes for Windows Store apps</h3>
If a Windows Store app uses <b>TakeOwnership</b>, it fails with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3ddxgi/dxgi-error">DXGI_ERROR_NOT_CURRENTLY_AVAILABLE</a>.
