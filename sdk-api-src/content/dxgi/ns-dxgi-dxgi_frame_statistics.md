# DXGI_FRAME_STATISTICS structure


## -description


Describes timing and presentation statistics for a frame.


## -struct-fields




### -field PresentCount

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT</a></b>

A value that represents the running total count of times that an image was presented to the monitor since the computer booted.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The number of times that an image was presented to the monitor is not necessarily the same as the number of times 
        that you called <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dxgi/nf-dxgi-idxgiswapchain-present">IDXGISwapChain::Present</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dxgi1_2/nf-dxgi1_2-idxgiswapchain1-present1">IDXGISwapChain1::Present1</a>.</div>
<div> </div>

### -field PresentRefreshCount

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT</a></b>

A value that represents  the running total count of v-blanks at which the last image was presented to the monitor and that have happened since the computer booted (for windowed mode, since the swap chain was created).


### -field SyncRefreshCount

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT</a></b>

A value that represents  the running total count of v-blanks when the scheduler last sampled the machine time by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/profileapi/nf-profileapi-queryperformancecounter">QueryPerformanceCounter</a> and that have happened since the computer booted (for windowed mode, since the swap chain was created).


### -field SyncQPCTime

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-large_integer~r1">LARGE_INTEGER</a></b>

A value that represents the high-resolution performance counter timer. 
        This value is the same as the value returned by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/profileapi/nf-profileapi-queryperformancecounter">QueryPerformanceCounter</a> 
        function.


### -field SyncGPUTime

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-large_integer~r1">LARGE_INTEGER</a></b>

Reserved. Always returns 0.


## -remarks



You initialize the <b>DXGI_FRAME_STATISTICS</b> structure with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dxgi/nf-dxgi-idxgioutput-getframestatistics">IDXGIOutput::GetFrameStatistics</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dxgi/nf-dxgi-idxgiswapchain-getframestatistics">IDXGISwapChain::GetFrameStatistics</a> method.

You can only use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dxgi/nf-dxgi-idxgiswapchain-getframestatistics">IDXGISwapChain::GetFrameStatistics</a> for swap chains that either use the flip presentation model or draw in full-screen mode. You set the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dxgi/ne-dxgi-dxgi_swap_effect">DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_FLIP_SEQUENTIAL</a> value in the <b>SwapEffect</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dxgi1_2/ns-dxgi1_2-dxgi_swap_chain_desc1">DXGI_SWAP_CHAIN_DESC1</a> structure to specify that the swap chain uses the flip presentation model.

The values in the <b>PresentCount</b> and <b>PresentRefreshCount</b> members indicate information about when a frame was presented on the display screen. You can use these values to determine whether a glitch occurred. The values in the <b>SyncRefreshCount</b> and <b>SyncQPCTime</b> members indicate timing information that you can use for audio and video synchronization or very precise animation. If the swap chain draws in full-screen mode, these values are based on when the computer booted. 
If the swap chain draws in windowed mode, these values are based on when the swap chain is created.
