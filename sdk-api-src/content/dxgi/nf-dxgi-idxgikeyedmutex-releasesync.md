# IDXGIKeyedMutex::ReleaseSync


## -description


Using a key, releases exclusive rendering access to a shared resource.


## -parameters




### -param Key

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT64</a></b>

A value that indicates which device to give access to. This method succeeds when the device that currently owns the surface calls the <b>ReleaseSync</b> method using the same value. This value can be any UINT64 value.


## -returns



Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/com/structure-of-com-error-codes">HRESULT</a></b>

Returns S_OK if successful.

If the device attempted to release a keyed mutex that is not valid or owned by the device, <b>ReleaseSync</b> returns E_FAIL.




## -remarks



The <b>ReleaseSync</b> method releases a lock to a surface that is shared between multiple devices.  This method uses a key to determine which device currently has exclusive access to the surface.

When a surface is created using the <b>D3D10_RESOURCE_MISC_SHARED_KEYEDMUTEX</b> value of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d10/ne-d3d10-d3d10_resource_misc_flag">D3D10_RESOURCE_MISC_FLAG</a> enumeration, 
      you must call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dxgi/nf-dxgi-idxgikeyedmutex-acquiresync">IDXGIKeyedMutex::AcquireSync</a> method before rendering to the surface.  You must call the <b>ReleaseSync</b> method when you are done 
      rendering to a surface.

After you call the <b>ReleaseSync</b> method, the shared resource is unset from the rendering pipeline. 

To acquire a reference to the keyed mutex object of a shared resource, call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-queryinterface(q)">QueryInterface</a> method of the resource and pass in 
      the <b>UUID</b> of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dxgi/nn-dxgi-idxgikeyedmutex">IDXGIKeyedMutex</a> interface.  For more information about acquiring this reference, see the following code example.


#### Examples

<b>Acquiring a Keyed Mutex</b>

The following code example demonstrates how to acquire a lock to a shared resource and how to specify a key upon release.


```

// pDesc has already been set up with texture description.
pDesc.MiscFlags = D3D10_RESOURCE_MISC_SHARED_KEYEDMUTEX;

// Create a shared texture resource.
pD3D10DeviceD->CreateTexture2D(pDesc, NULL, pD3D10Texture);

// Acquire a reference to the keyed mutex.
pD3D10Texture->QueryInterface(_uuidof(IDXGIKeyedMutex), pDXGIKeyedMutex);

// Acquire a lock to the resource.
pDXGIKeyedMutex->AcquireSync(0, INFINITE);

// Release the lock and specify a key.
pDXGIKeyedMutex->ReleaseSync(1);

```
