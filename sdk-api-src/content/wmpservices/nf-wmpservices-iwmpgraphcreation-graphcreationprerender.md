# IWMPGraphCreation::GraphCreationPreRender


## -description


The <b>GraphCreationPreRender</b> method is called by Windows Media Player before a file is rendered.


## -parameters




### -param pFilterGraph [in]

Pointer to the <b>IUnknown</b> interface of the Windows Media Player control's DirectShow filter graph.


### -param pReserved [in]

Reserved for future use.


## -returns



Return a success <b>HRESULT</b> to allow playback to continue or a failure code to terminate playback.




## -remarks



You can call <b>QueryInterface</b> through <i>pFilterGraph</i> to retrieve the DirectShow filter graph interfaces you require.

There is no guarantee that this method will be invoked for all files.  Only files rendered with DirectShow will cause this method to be invoked and the WMPGC_FLAGS_USE_CUSTOM_GRAPH flag to be honored. CD, DVD, Image, Flash, Windows Media Format SDK, and Media Foundation playback will not invoke this method.


<b>Windows Media Player 10 Mobile: </b>This method is not supported.
