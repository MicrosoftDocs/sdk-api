# WFDOpenHandle function


## -description

The <b>WFDOpenHandle</b> function opens a handle to the Wi-Fi Direct service and negotiates a version of the Wi-FI Direct API to use.

## -parameters

### -param dwClientVersion [in]

The highest version of the Wi-Fi Direct API the client supports.

For Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, this parameter should be set to <b>WFD_API_VERSION</b>, constant defined in the <i>Wlanapi.h</i> header file.

### -param pdwNegotiatedVersion [out]

A pointer to a <b>DWORD</b> to received the negotiated version.

If the <b>WFDOpenHandle</b> function is successful, the version negotiated with the Wi-Fi Direct Service to be used by this session is returned. This value is usually the highest version supported by both the client and Wi-Fi Direct service.

### -param phClientHandle [out]

A pointer to a <b>HANDLE</b> to receive the handle to the Wi-Fi Direct service for this session.

If the <b>WFDOpenHandle</b> function is successful, a handle to the Wi-Fi Direct service to use in this session is returned.

## -returns

If the function succeeds, the return value is ERROR_SUCCESS.

If the function fails, the return value may be one of the following return codes.

## -remarks

The <b>WFDOpenHandle</b> function is part of Wi-Fi Direct, a new feature in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012. Wi-Fi Direct is based on the development of the Wi-Fi Peer-to-Peer Technical Specification v1.1 by the Wi-Fi Alliance (see <a href="https://www.wi-fi.org/featured-topics">Wi-Fi Alliance Published Specifications</a>). The goal of the Wi-Fi Peer-to-Peer Technical Specification is to provide a solution for Wi-Fi device-to-device connectivity without the need for either a Wireless Access Point (wireless AP) to setup the connection or the use of the existing Wi-Fi adhoc (IBSS) mechanism. 



In order to use Wi-Fi Direct, an application must first obtain a handle to the Wi-Fi Direct service by calling the <b>WFDOpenHandle</b> function. The Wi-Fi Direct (WFD) handle returned by the  <b>WFDOpenHandle</b> function is used for subsequent calls made to the Wi-Fi Direct service. Once an application is done using the Wi-Fi Direct service, the application should call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wlanapi/nf-wlanapi-wfdclosehandle">WFDCloseHandle</a> function to signal to the Wi-Fi Direct service that the application is done using the service. This allows the  Wi-Fi Direct service  to release resources used by the application.
