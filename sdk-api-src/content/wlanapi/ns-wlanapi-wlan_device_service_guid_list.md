## -description

Contains an array of device service GUIDs.

## -struct-fields

### -field dwNumberOfItems

Type: **[DWORD](/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types)**

The number of items in the *DeviceService* argument.

### -field dwIndex

Type: **[DWORD](/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types)**

The index of the current item. The index of the first item is 0. *dwIndex* must be less than *dwNumberOfItems*. This member is not used by the wireless service. You can use this member when processing individual **GUID**s in the **WLAN_DEVICE_SERVICE_GUID_LIST** structure. When your application passes this structure from one function to another, it can set the value of *dwIndex* to the index of the item currently being processed. This can help your application maintain state. You should always initialize *dwIndex* before use.

### -field DeviceService

Type: **[GUID](/windows/win32/api/guiddef/ns-guiddef-guid)\[1\]**

A pointer to an array containing **GUID**s; each corresponds to a WLAN device service that the driver supports.
