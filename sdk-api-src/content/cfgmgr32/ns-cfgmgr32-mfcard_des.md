# MFCARD_DES structure


## -description


The MFCARD_DES structure is used for specifying either a resource list or a resource requirements list that describes resource usage by <i>one</i> of the hardware functions provided by an instance of a multifunction device. For more information about resource lists and resource requirements lists, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/hardware-resources">Hardware Resources</a>.


## -struct-fields




### -field PMF_Count

Must be 1.


### -field PMF_Type

<i>Not used.</i>


### -field PMF_Flags

One bit flag is defined, as described in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
fPMF_AUDIO_ENABLE

</td>
<td>
If set, audio is enabled.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field PMF_ConfigOptions

Contents of the 8-bit PCMCIA Configuration Option Register.


### -field PMF_IoResourceIndex

Zero-based index indicating the [IO_RESOURCE](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/cfgmgr32/ns-cfgmgr32-io_resource)a> structure that describes the I/O resources for the hardware function being described by this MFCARD_DES structure.


### -field PMF_Reserved

<i>Not used.</i>


### -field PMF_ConfigRegisterBase

Offset from the beginning of the card's attribute memory space to the base configuration register address.
