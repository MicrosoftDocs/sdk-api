# PCCARD_DES structure


## -description


The PCCARD_DES structure is used for specifying either a resource list or a resource requirements list that describes resource usage by a PC Card instance. For more information about resource lists and resource requirements lists, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/hardware-resources">Hardware Resources</a>.


## -struct-fields
