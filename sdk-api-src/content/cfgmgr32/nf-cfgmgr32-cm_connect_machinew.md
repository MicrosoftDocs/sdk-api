## -parameters




### -param UNCServerName [in, optional]

Caller-supplied pointer to a text string representing the UNC name, including the <b>\\</b> prefix, of the system for which a connection will be made. If the pointer is <b>NULL</b>, the local system is used.


### -param phMachine [out]

Address of a location to receive a machine handle.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Using this function to access remote machines is not supported beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, as this functionality has been removed.</div>
<div> </div>

## -returns



If the operation succeeds, the function returns CR_SUCCESS. Otherwise, it returns one of the CR_-prefixed error codes defined in <i>Cfgmgr32.h</i>.




## -remarks



Callers of <b>CM_Connect_Machine</b> must call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/cfgmgr32/nf-cfgmgr32-cm_disconnect_machine">CM_Disconnect_Machine</a> to deallocate the machine handle, after it is no longer needed.

Use machine handles obtained with this function only with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/ff549713(v=vs.85)">PnP configuration manager functions</a>.

 Functionality to access remote machines has been removed in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 and later operating systems thus you cannot access remote machines when running on these versions of Windows.
