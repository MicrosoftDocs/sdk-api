# AVRF_HEAP_ALLOCATION structure


## -description


Stores metadata information about heap allocation.


## -struct-fields




### -field HeapHandle

The handle to the heap being enumerated.


### -field UserAllocation

The address of the heap allocation as seen by the application.


### -field UserAllocationSize

The size, in bytes, of the application's allocation on the heap.


### -field Allocation

The address of the heap allocation as seen by the operating system.


### -field AllocationSize

The size, in bytes, of the heap allocation as seen by the operating system.


### -field UserAllocationState

One of the values in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/avrfsdk/ne-avrfsdk-euserallocationstate">eUserAllocationState</a> enumerated type.


### -field HeapState

The state of the heap allocation. The user can extract one of the values in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/avrfsdk/ne-avrfsdk-eheapallocationstate">eHeapAllocationState</a> enum after AND-ing the <b>HeapStateMask</b> value.


### -field HeapContext

The context of the heap currently allocated.


### -field BackTraceInformation

A pointer to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/avrfsdk/ns-avrfsdk-avrf_backtrace_information">AVRF_BACKTRACE_INFORMATION</a> structure containing information about the last operation that occurred on the allocation. 

When available, it can be the stack backtrace of the place where the address specified in the <b>UserAllocation</b> member of the structure was allocated (if <b>UserAllocationState</b> is <b>AllocationstateBusy</b>) or where the address specified in the <b>UserAllocation</b> member was freed (if <b>UserAllocationState</b> is <b>AllocationStateFree</b>).
