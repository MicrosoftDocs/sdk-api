## -remarks



This method is called when the first client session opens a handle to an inactive biometric unit.

Neither the Sensor nor the Engine adapters have been activated when this method is called.

Returning any <b>HRESULT</b> other than <b>S_OK</b> will cause the Windows Biometric Framework to log the error and abort the activation of the biometric unit.

This method executes in the context of the sensor control thread that will process all other requests for the unit, including deactivation.
