### -param lbfEnAttr2 [in]

Specifies the content attributes of the second rating, as a bitwise combination of flags from the <a href="/previous-versions/dd318226(v=vs.85)">BfEnTvRat_GenericAttributes</a> enumeration.

### -param penSystem [out]

## -remarks

This method enables the client to determine which of two ratings is more restrictive. For example, in the MPAA system, PG is more restrictive than R. The more restrictive rating is returned in the <i>penSystem</i>, <i>penEnLevel</i>, and <i>plbfEnAttr</i> parameters.

When the method compares ratings from two different ratings systems, it returns a rating expressed in the first system, unless the first system is unknown (TvRat_SystemDontKnow). In that case, it returns a rating using the second system.

The method returns S_FALSE if the ratings systems are not the same. There may not be an exact mapping between the two systems.
