# IInitializeWithStream::Initialize


## -description


Initializes a handler with a stream.


## -parameters




### -param pstream [in]

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-istream">IStream</a>*</b>

A pointer to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-istream">IStream</a> interface that represents the stream source.


### -param grfMode [in]

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

One of the following <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Stg/stgm-constants">STGM</a> values that indicates the access mode for <i>pstream</i>.



#### STGM_READ

The stream indicated by <i>pstream</i> is read-only.



#### STGM_READWRITE

The stream indicated by <i>pstream</i> is read/write accessible.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



This method is preferred to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/propsys/nf-propsys-iinitializewithfile-initialize">Initialize</a> due to its ability to use streams that are not accessible through a Win32 path, such as the contents of a compressed file with a .zip file name extension.

The stream pointed to by <i>pstream</i> must remain open for the lifetime of the handler or until <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/bb761470(v=vs.85)">IPropertyStore::Commit</a> is called.

When first opened, the source stream reference points to the beginning of the stream. The handler can seek and read from the stream at any time. A handler can be implemented to read all properties from the stream during <b>Initialize</b> or it can wait until the calling process attempts to enumerate or read properties before fetching them from the stream.

A handler instance should be initialized only once in its lifetime. Attempts by the caller to reinitialize the handler should result in the error <code>HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_ALREADY_INITIALIZED)</code>.
