# IInitializeWithFile::Initialize


## -description


Initializes a handler with a file path.


## -parameters




### -param pszFilePath [in]

Type: <b>LPCWSTR</b>

A pointer to a buffer that contains the file path as a null-terminated Unicode string.


### -param grfMode [in]

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

One of the following <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Stg/stgm-constants">STGM</a> values that indicates the access mode for <i>pszFilePath</i>.



#### STGM_READ

The file indicated by <b>IInitializeWithFile::Initialize</b> is read-only.



#### STGM_READWRITE

The file indicated by <b>IInitializeWithFile::Initialize</b> can be read from and written to.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks




<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/propsys/nf-propsys-iinitializewithstream-initialize">Initialize</a> is preferred to this method because of its ability to use files that are not accessible through a Win32 path, such as the contents of a compressed file with a .zip file name extension. Use <b>IInitializeWithFile::Initialize</b> only when the API used by the handler to access the file accepts file paths only.

The file pointed to by <i>pszFilePath</i> must remain open for the lifetime of the handler or until <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/bb761470(v=vs.85)">IPropertyStore::Commit</a> is called.

If the file cannot be opened according to the method's parameter values, this method returns a suitable error code.

A handler instance should be initialized only once in its lifetime. Attempts by the calling application to reinitialize the handler should result in the error <code>HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_ALREADY_INITIALIZED)</code>.
