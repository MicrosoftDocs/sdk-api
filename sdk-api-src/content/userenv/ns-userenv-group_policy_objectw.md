### -field lpFileSysPath

Pointer to a string that specifies the path to the file system portion of the GPO.

### -field lpDisplayName

Pointer to the display name of the GPO.

### -field szGPOName

Pointer to a string that specifies a unique name that identifies the GPO.

### -field GPOLink

Specifies the link information for the GPO. This member may be one of the following values.



#### GPLinkUnknown

No link information is available.



#### GPLinkMachine

The GPO is linked to a computer (local or remote).



#### GPLinkSite

The GPO is linked to a site.



#### GPLinkDomain

The GPO is linked to a domain.



#### GPLinkOrganizationalUnit

The GPO is linked to an organizational unit.

### -field lParam

User-supplied data.

### -field pNext

Pointer to the next GPO in the list.

### -field pPrev

Pointer to the previous GPO in the list.

### -field lpExtensions

Extensions that have stored data in this GPO. The format is a string of <b>GUID</b>s grouped in brackets. For more information, see the following Remarks section.

### -field lParam2

User-supplied data.

### -field lpLink

Path to the Active Directory site, domain, or organization unit to which this GPO is linked. If the GPO is linked to the local GPO, this member is "Local".


##### - GPOLink.GPLinkDomain

The GPO is linked to a domain.


##### - GPOLink.GPLinkMachine

The GPO is linked to a computer (local or remote).


##### - GPOLink.GPLinkOrganizationalUnit

The GPO is linked to an organizational unit.


##### - GPOLink.GPLinkSite

The GPO is linked to a site.


##### - GPOLink.GPLinkUnknown

No link information is available.


##### - dwOptions.GPO_FLAG_DISABLE

This GPO is disabled.


##### - dwOptions.GPO_FLAG_FORCE

Do not override the policy settings in this GPO with policy settings in a subsequent GPO.

## -remarks

Each GPO could contain data that must be processed by multiple snap-in extensions. Therefore, the data in the <b>lpExtensions</b> member is organized as a series of <b>GUID</b>s that identify the extensions and snap-in extensions. The data format is as follows:


```cpp
[ext_guid1, snap_in_guid1, snap_in_guid2, ...] 
[ext_guid2, snap_in_guid3, snap_in_guid4, ...] 
```


First, there is an opening bracket, "[", followed by the <b>GUID</b> of the extension. Next, you'll find one or more <b>GUID</b>s identifying the snap-in extensions that have stored data in the GPO. After the last snap-in <b>GUID</b> for an extension, there is a closing bracket, "]". This pattern is repeated for the next extension.





> [!NOTE]
> The userenv.h header defines GROUP_POLICY_OBJECT as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
