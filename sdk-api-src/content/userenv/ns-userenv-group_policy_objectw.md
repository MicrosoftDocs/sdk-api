#### GPLinkMachine

The GPO is linked to a computer (local or remote).



#### GPLinkSite

## -remarks



Each GPO could contain data that must be processed by multiple snap-in extensions. Therefore, the data in the <b>lpExtensions</b> member is organized as a series of <b>GUID</b>s that identify the extensions and snap-in extensions. The data format is as follows:


```cpp
[ext_guid1, snap_in_guid1, snap_in_guid2, ...] 
[ext_guid2, snap_in_guid3, snap_in_guid4, ...] 
```


First, there is an opening bracket, "[", followed by the <b>GUID</b> of the extension. Next, you'll find one or more <b>GUID</b>s identifying the snap-in extensions that have stored data in the GPO. After the last snap-in <b>GUID</b> for an extension, there is a closing bracket, "]". This pattern is repeated for the next extension.





> [!NOTE]
> The userenv.h header defines GROUP_POLICY_OBJECT as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
