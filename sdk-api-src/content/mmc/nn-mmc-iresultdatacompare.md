# IResultDataCompare interface


## -description

The 
<b>IResultDataCompare</b> interface allows primary snap-ins to compare result items that are displayed in a sorted order in the result pane. MMC uses a primary snap-in's implementation of this interface for all results items. Scope items from either the primary snap-in or any extensions are left unsorted at the top of the list.

The 
<b>IResultDataCompare</b> interface differs from the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/mmc/nn-mmc-iresultdatacompareex">IResultDataCompareEx</a> interface. 
<b>IResultDataCompareEx</b> allows primary snap-ins to compare both scope and result items.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IResultDataCompare</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IResultDataCompare</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
