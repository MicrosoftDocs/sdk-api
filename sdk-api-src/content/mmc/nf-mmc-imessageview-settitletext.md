# IMessageView::SetTitleText


## -description


The <b>IMessageView::SetTitleText</b> method enables a snap-in to set the title text for the result pane message displayed using the MMC message OCX control.


## -parameters




### -param pszTitleText [in]

A pointer to a null-terminated string that contains the title text for the result pane message.


## -returns



This method can return one of these values.




## -remarks



MMC creates its own copies of the strings passed to it when the snap-in calls the IMessageView::SetTitleText and IMessageView::SetBodyText methods. The snap-in can release the resources at any time after calling 
<b>SetTitleText</b> and 
<b>SetBodyText</b>.
