# MMC_MENU_COMMAND_IDS enumeration


## -description


The 
<b>MMC_MENU_COMMAND_IDS</b> enumeration defines the Command Identifiers that are reserved by MMC.


## -enum-fields




### -field MMCC_STANDARD_VIEW_SELECT

Sent to a snap-in's 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mmc/nf-mmc-iextendcontextmenu-command">IExtendContextMenu::Command</a> method when the user switches from a custom result view to the standard list view.


## -remarks



Typically, a snap-in's 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mmc/nf-mmc-iextendcontextmenu-command">IExtendContextMenu::Command</a> method is called only when one of its own menu items is selected. The MMCC_* codes are sent when a built-in menu item is selected and the snap-in must be notified about the selection. Other MMCC_* codes can be added later.

MMCC_STANDARD_VIEW_SELECT notifies the snap-in that the custom view is going away and that the snap-in can do any necessary clean-up. The next time the snap-in's 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mmc/nf-mmc-icomponent-getresultviewtype">IComponent::GetResultViewType</a> method is called, the snap-in should return S_FALSE to indicate that the default list view should be used.
