# IStringTable interface


## -description

The 
<b>IStringTable</b> interface is introduced in MMC 1.1.

The 
<b>IStringTable</b> interface provides a way to store string data with the snap-in. A string table is created in the console file as required for each snap-in by MMC.

The 
<b>IStringTable</b> interface allows strings to be saved in the console file. Be aware that this interface is designed to work with specialized localization tools. Snap-ins without access to these localization tools will not benefit from using this interface.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IStringTable</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IStringTable</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
