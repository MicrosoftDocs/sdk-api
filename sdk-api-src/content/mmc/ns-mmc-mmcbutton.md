# MMCBUTTON structure


## -description


The 
<b>MMCBUTTON</b> structure contains values used in creating buttons on a toolbar. This structure is similar to the <b>TBBUTTON</b> structure discussed in the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) topics related to common controls.


## -struct-fields




### -field nBitmap

A value that specifies the zero-based index of a button image.


### -field idCommand

A value that specifies the command identifier returned when a button is clicked. This can be any integer value the user wants. Only the low word of the <b>int</b> is used.


### -field fsState

A value that specifies the button-state flags. This member can be any of the following values:



#### TBSTATE_CHECKED

The button has the TBSTYLE_CHECKED style and is being pressed.



#### TBSTATE_ENABLED

The button accepts user input. A button that does not have this state does not accept user input and appears dimmed.



#### TBSTATE_HIDDEN

The button is not visible and cannot receive user input.



#### TBSTATE_INDETERMINATE

The button appears dimmed.



#### TBSTATE_PRESSED

The button is being pressed.


### -field fsType

A value that specifies the button style. This member can be any combination of the following values:



#### TBSTYLE_BUTTON

Creates a standard push button.



#### TBSTYLE_CHECK

Creates a button that toggles between the pressed and not-pressed states each time the user clicks it. The button has a different background color when it is in the pressed state.



#### TBSTYLE_CHECKGROUP

Creates a check button that stays pressed until another button in the group is pressed.



#### TBSTYLE_GROUP

Creates a button that stays pressed until another button in the group is pressed.



#### TBSTYLE_SEP

Creates a separator, providing a small gap between button groups. A button that has this style does not receive user input.

<b>MMCBUTTON</b> structure.


### -field lpTooltipText
