# IResultDataCompareEx interface


## -description


The 
<b>IResultDataCompareEx</b> interface is introduced in MMC 1.2.

The 
<b>IResultDataCompareEx</b> interface allows primary snap-ins to compare both scope and result items that are displayed in a sorted order in the result pane. MMC uses a primary snap-in's implementation of this interface for all scope and result items. Any scope items inserted by extension snap-ins are left unsorted at the bottom of the list.

The 
<b>IResultDataCompareEx</b> interface differs from the 
<b>IResultDataCompareEx</b> interface. 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mmc/nn-mmc-iresultdatacompare">IResultDataCompare</a> allows primary snap-ins to compare only result items. Scope items from either the primary snap-in or any extensions are left unsorted at the top of the list.


## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IResultDataCompareEx</b> interface inherits from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IResultDataCompareEx</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
