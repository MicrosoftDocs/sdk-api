# SNodeID structure


## -description


The 
<b>SNodeID</b> structure is introduced in MMC 1.1, and is replaced by the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mmc/ns-mmc-snodeid2">SNodeID2</a> structure in MMC 1.2.

The 
<b>SNodeID</b> structure defines the format of the data for the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/mmc/ccf-nodeid">CCF_NODEID</a> clipboard format.

The 
<b>SNodeID</b> structure contains an array of bytes that represent the node ID.


## -struct-fields




### -field cBytes

The count of bytes in the <b>id</b> array.

The snap-in can also specify that a scope item should not be re-expanded when the console is reopened. To do this, set the <b>cBytes</b> member to 0 (zero) and return <b>S_OK</b> in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-idataobject-getdata">IDataObject::GetData</a> method. Be aware that this setting not only keeps the selected item from being persisted but also prevents its parent item from automatically expanding when the console file is reopened.


### -field id

The bytes that contains the node ID of the scope item.


## -remarks



Your snap-in should support the <b>CCF_NODEID</b> clipboard format in its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-idataobject-getdata">IDataObject::GetData</a> method if any of its enumerated items has a volatile display name (such as the current computer name) or if any enumerated items should not be restored when the console file is reopened.

For details on using the 
<b>SNodeID</b> structure and <b>CCF_NODEID</b> clipboard format, see 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/mmc/ccf-nodeid">CCF_NODEID</a>.
