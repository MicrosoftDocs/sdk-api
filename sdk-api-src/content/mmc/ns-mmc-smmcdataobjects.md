# SMMCDataObjects structure


## -description


The 
<b>SMMCDataObjects</b> structure defines the format of the data for the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/mmc/ccf-multi-select-snapins">CCF_MULTI_SELECT_SNAPINS</a> clipboard format. The structure contains the array of pointers to the multiselection data object of each snap-in represented in the set of selected items in the result pane.


## -struct-fields




### -field count

The number of snap-ins whose items are selected in the result pane.


### -field lpDataObject

Array of pointers to the multiselection data objects for each snap-in selected in the result pane.


## -remarks



Each data object consists of the node types associated with a given snap-in. Data objects are passed using 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-globalalloc">GlobalAlloc</a>.

The multiselection data objects hold a list that contains each node type represented in the set of selected items for that particular snap-in in the result pane. The list of node types from a particular multiselection data object can be retrieved as an array of node type GUIDs by calling <b>IDataObject::GetData</b> on that data object with the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/mmc/ccf-object-types-in-multi-select">CCF_OBJECT_TYPES_IN_MULTI_SELECT</a> clipboard format.

Each multiselection data object also holds a list that contains the selected items owned by a particular snap-in. Each snap-in is responsible for defining the format and method of retrieval of the list of its selected items.
