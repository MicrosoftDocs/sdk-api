# IImageList::ImageListSetStrip


## -description


The <b>IImageList::ImageListSetStrip</b> method enables a user to add a strip of icons to the image list using a pair of bitmaps (large and small icons), starting at a location identified by nStartLoc.


## -parameters




### -param pBMapSm [in]

Win32 HBITMAP handle to the small (16x16) icon image strip. The snap-in owns this resource and must free it when finished. A resource memory leak will occur if the snap-in does not free BMapSm.


### -param pBMapLg [in]

Win32 HBITMAP handle to the large (32x32) icon image strip. The snap-in owns this resource and must free it when finished. A resource memory leak will occur if the snap-in does not free BMapLg.


### -param nStartLoc [in]

A value that specifies the index assigned to the first image in the strip. This is a virtual index that is internally mapped to the actual index.


### -param cMask [in]

A value that specifies the color used to generate a mask.


## -returns



This method can return one of these values.




## -remarks



Both small and large bitmaps must be provided and the number of icons in each strip must be equal. The small bitmap must be 16 pixels high and 16*n pixels wide, where n is an integer value. The large bitmap must be 32 pixels high and 32*n pixels wide.

Each pixel of the color used to generate a mask in the specified bitmap is changed to black and the corresponding bit in the mask is set to one.
