## -remarks



When any notification limit specified in a JOBOBJECT_NOTIFICATION_LIMIT_INFORMATION structure is exceeded, the system sends a JOB_OBJECT_MSG_NOTIFICATION_LIMIT message to the I/O completion port associated with the job.

To retrieve information about the limits that were exceeded, the application monitoring the I/O completion port must call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/jobapi2/nf-jobapi2-queryinformationjobobject">QueryInformationJobObject</a> function with the <b>JobObjectLimitViolationInformation</b> information class and a pointer to a <b>JOBOBJECT_LIMIT_VIOLATION_INFORMATION</b> structure.
