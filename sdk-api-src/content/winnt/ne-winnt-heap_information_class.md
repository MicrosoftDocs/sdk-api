# HEAP_INFORMATION_CLASS enumeration


## -description


Specifies the class of heap information to be set or retrieved. 


## -enum-fields




### -field HeapCompatibilityInformation

The heap features that are enabled. The available features vary based on operating system. Depending on the <i>HeapInformation</i> parameter in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heapqueryinformation">HeapQueryInformation</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heapsetinformation">HeapSetInformation</a> functions, specifying this enumeration value can indicate one of the following features:

<ul>
<li>A standard heap that does not support look-aside lists.</li>
<li>A heap that supports look-aside lists.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Memory/low-fragmentation-heap">low-fragmentation heap</a> (LFH), which does not support look-aside lists.</li>
</ul>
For more information about look-aside lists, see the Remarks section.


### -field HeapEnableTerminationOnCorruption

The terminate-on-corruption feature. If the heap manager detects an error in any heap used by the 
         process, it calls the Windows Error Reporting service and terminates the process.

After a process enables this feature, it cannot be disabled.


### -field HeapOptimizeResources




## -remarks



To retrieve information about a heap, use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heapqueryinformation">HeapQueryInformation</a> function. To enable features for a heap, use the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heapsetinformation">HeapSetInformation</a> function.

<b>Windows XP and Windows Server 2003:  </b> A look-aside list is a fast memory allocation mechanism that contains only fixed-sized blocks. Look-aside lists are enabled by default for heaps that support them. Starting with Windows Vista, look-aside lists are not used and the LFH is enabled by default.

Look-aside lists are faster than general pool allocations that vary in size, because the system does not search for free memory that fits the allocation. In addition, access to look-aside lists is generally synchronized using fast atomic processor exchange instructions instead of mutexes or spinlocks. Look-aside lists can be created by the system or drivers. They can be allocated from paged or nonpaged pool.
