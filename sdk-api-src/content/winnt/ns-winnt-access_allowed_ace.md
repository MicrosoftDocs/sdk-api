# ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE structure


## -description


The <b>ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE</b> structure defines an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/a-gly">access control entry</a> (ACE) for the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/d-gly">discretionary access control list</a> (DACL) that controls access to an object. An access-allowed ACE allows access to an object for a specific <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/t-gly">trustee</a> identified by a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly">security identifier</a> (SID).
		


## -struct-fields




### -field Header


<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winnt/ns-winnt-ace_header">ACE_HEADER</a> structure that specifies the size and type of ACE. It also contains flags that control inheritance of the ACE by child objects. The <b>AceType</b> member of the <b>ACE_HEADER</b> structure should be set to ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE_TYPE, and the <b>AceSize</b> member should be set to the total number of bytes allocated for the <b>ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE</b> structure.


### -field Mask

Specifies an 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecAuthZ/access-mask">ACCESS_MASK</a> structure that specifies the access rights granted by this ACE.


### -field SidStart

The first <b>DWORD</b> of a trustee's SID. The remaining bytes of the SID  are stored in contiguous memory after the <b>SidStart</b> member. This SID can be appended with application data.


## -remarks



ACE structures must be aligned on <b>DWORD</b> boundaries. All Windows memory-management functions return <b>DWORD</b>-aligned handles to memory.

The access rights specified by the <b>Mask</b> member are granted to any <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/t-gly">trustee</a> that possesses an enabled SID that matches the SID stored in the <b>SidStart</b> member.

An <b>ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE</b> structure can be created in an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/a-gly">access control list</a> (ACL) by a call to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-addaccessallowedace">AddAccessAllowedAce</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-addaccessallowedaceex">AddAccessAllowedAceEx</a> function. When these functions are used, the correct amount of memory needed to accommodate the trustee's SID is allocated and the values of the <b>Header.AceType</b> and <b>Header.AceSize</b> members are set automatically. If the <b>AddAccessAllowedAceEx</b> function is used, the <b>Header.AceFlags</b> member is also set. When an <b>ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE</b> structure is created outside an ACL, sufficient memory must be allocated to accommodate the complete SID of the trustee in the <b>SidStart</b> member and the contiguous memory following it, and the values of the <b>Header.AceType</b>, <b>Header.AceFlags</b>, and <b>Header.AceSize</b> members must be set explicitly by the application.
