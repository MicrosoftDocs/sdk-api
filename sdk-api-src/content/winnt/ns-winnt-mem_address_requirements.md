# MEM_ADDRESS_REQUIREMENTS structure


## -description

Specifies a lowest and highest base address and alignment as part of an extended parameter to a function that manages virtual memory.

## -struct-fields

### -field LowestStartingAddress

Specifies the lowest acceptable address.
This address must be a multiple of the allocation granularity returned by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getsysteminfo">GetSystemInfo</a>,
or a multiple of the large page size returned by <a href="/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-getlargepageminimum">GetLargePageMinimum</a> if large pages are being requested.
If this member is <b>NULL</b>, then there is no lower limit.

### -field HighestEndingAddress

Specifies the highest acceptable address (inclusive).
This address must not exceed <b>lpMaximumApplicationAddress</b> returned by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getsysteminfo">GetSystemInfo</a>.
If this member is <b>NULL</b>, then there is no upper limit.

### -field Alignment

Specifies power-of-2 alignment. Specifying 0 aligns the returned address on the system allocation granularity.

## -remarks

Specifying a <b>MEM_ADDRESS_REQUIREMENTS</b> structure with all fields set to 0 is the same as not specifying one at all.
