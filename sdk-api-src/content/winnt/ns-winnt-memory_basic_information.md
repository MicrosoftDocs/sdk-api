# MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION structure


## -description


Contains information about a range of pages in the virtual address space of a process. The 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualquery">VirtualQuery</a> and 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualqueryex">VirtualQueryEx</a> functions use this structure.


## -struct-fields




### -field BaseAddress

A pointer to the base address of the region of pages.


### -field AllocationBase

A pointer to the base address of a range of pages allocated by the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc">VirtualAlloc</a> function. The page pointed to by the <b>BaseAddress</b> member is contained within this allocation range.


### -field AllocationProtect

The memory protection option when the region was initially allocated. This member can be one of the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Memory/memory-protection-constants">memory protection constants</a> or 0 if the caller does not have access.


### -field RegionSize

The size of the region beginning at the base address in which all pages have identical attributes, in bytes.


### -field State

The state of the pages in the region. This member can be one of the following values. 



<table>
<tr>
<th>State</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="MEM_COMMIT"></a><a id="mem_commit"></a><dl>
<dt><b>MEM_COMMIT</b></dt>
<dt>0x1000</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates committed pages for which physical storage has been allocated, either in memory or in the paging file on disk.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="MEM_FREE"></a><a id="mem_free"></a><dl>
<dt><b>MEM_FREE</b></dt>
<dt>0x10000</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates free pages not accessible to the calling process and available to be allocated. For free pages, the information in the <b>AllocationBase</b>, <b>AllocationProtect</b>, <b>Protect</b>, and <b>Type</b> members is undefined.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="MEM_RESERVE"></a><a id="mem_reserve"></a><dl>
<dt><b>MEM_RESERVE</b></dt>
<dt>0x2000</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates reserved pages where a range of the process's virtual address space is reserved without any physical storage being allocated. For reserved pages, the information in the <b>Protect</b> member is undefined.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field Protect

The access protection of the pages in the region. This member is one of the values listed for the <b>AllocationProtect</b> member.


### -field Type

The type of pages in the region. The following types are defined. 



<table>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="MEM_IMAGE"></a><a id="mem_image"></a><dl>
<dt><b>MEM_IMAGE</b></dt>
<dt>0x1000000</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates that the memory pages within the region are mapped into the view of an image section.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="MEM_MAPPED"></a><a id="mem_mapped"></a><dl>
<dt><b>MEM_MAPPED</b></dt>
<dt>0x40000</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates that the memory pages within the region are mapped into the view of a section.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="MEM_PRIVATE"></a><a id="mem_private"></a><dl>
<dt><b>MEM_PRIVATE</b></dt>
<dt>0x20000</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates that the memory pages within the region are private (that is, not shared by other processes).

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


## -remarks



To enable a debugger to debug a target that is running on a different architecture (32-bit versus 64-bit), use one of the explicit forms of this structure.


```cpp
typedef struct _MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION32 {
    DWORD BaseAddress;
    DWORD AllocationBase;
    DWORD AllocationProtect;
    DWORD RegionSize;
    DWORD State;
    DWORD Protect;
    DWORD Type;
} MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION32, *PMEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION32;

typedef struct DECLSPEC_ALIGN(16) _MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION64 {
    ULONGLONG BaseAddress;
    ULONGLONG AllocationBase;
    DWORD     AllocationProtect;
    DWORD     __alignment1;
    ULONGLONG RegionSize;
    DWORD     State;
    DWORD     Protect;
    DWORD     Type;
    DWORD     __alignment2;
} MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION64, *PMEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION64;
```
