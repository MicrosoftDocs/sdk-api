# JOBOBJECT_EXTENDED_LIMIT_INFORMATION structure


## -description


Contains basic and extended limit information for a job object.


## -struct-fields




### -field BasicLimitInformation

A 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winnt/ns-winnt-jobobject_basic_limit_information">JOBOBJECT_BASIC_LIMIT_INFORMATION</a> structure that contains basic limit information.


### -field IoInfo

Reserved.


### -field ProcessMemoryLimit

If the <b>LimitFlags</b> member of the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winnt/ns-winnt-jobobject_basic_limit_information">JOBOBJECT_BASIC_LIMIT_INFORMATION</a> structure specifies the <b>JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_PROCESS_MEMORY</b> value, this member specifies the limit for the virtual memory that can be committed by a process. Otherwise, this member is ignored.


### -field JobMemoryLimit

If the <b>LimitFlags</b> member of the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winnt/ns-winnt-jobobject_basic_limit_information">JOBOBJECT_BASIC_LIMIT_INFORMATION</a> structure specifies the <b>JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_JOB_MEMORY</b> value, this member specifies the limit for the virtual memory that can be committed for the job. Otherwise, this member is ignored.


### -field PeakProcessMemoryUsed

The peak memory used by any process ever associated with the job.


### -field PeakJobMemoryUsed

The peak memory usage of all processes currently associated with the job.


## -remarks



The system tracks the value of <b>PeakProcessMemoryUsed</b> and <b>PeakJobMemoryUsed</b> constantly. This allows you know the peak memory usage of each job. You can use this information to establish a memory limit using the <b>JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_PROCESS_MEMORY</b> or <b>JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_JOB_MEMORY</b> value.

Note that the job memory and process memory limits are very similar in operation, but they are independent. You could set a job-wide limit of 100 MB with a per-process limit of 10 MB. In this scenario, no single process could commit more than 10 MB, and the set of processes associated with a job could never exceed 100 MB.

To register for notifications  that a job has exceeded its peak memory limit while allowing processes to continue to commit memory, use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/jobapi2/nf-jobapi2-setinformationjobobject">SetInformationJobObject</a> function with the <b>JobObjectNotificationLimitInformation</b> information class.
