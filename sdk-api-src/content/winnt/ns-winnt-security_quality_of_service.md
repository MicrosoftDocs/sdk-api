# SECURITY_QUALITY_OF_SERVICE structure


## -description


The <b>SECURITY_QUALITY_OF_SERVICE</b> data structure contains information used to support client impersonation. A client can specify this information when it connects to a server; the information determines whether the server may impersonate the client, and if so, to what extent.


## -struct-fields




### -field Length

Specifies the size, in bytes, of this structure.


### -field ImpersonationLevel

Specifies the information given to the server about the client, and how the server may represent, or impersonate, the client. Security impersonation levels govern the degree to which a server process can act on behalf of a client <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/p-gly">process</a>. This member is a 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winnt/ne-winnt-security_impersonation_level">SECURITY_IMPERSONATION_LEVEL</a> enumeration type value.


### -field ContextTrackingMode

Specifies whether the server is to be given a snapshot of the client's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly">security context</a> (called static tracking), or is to be continually updated to track changes to the client's security context (called dynamic tracking). The SECURITY_STATIC_TRACKING value  specifies static tracking, and the SECURITY_DYNAMIC_TRACKING value specifies dynamic tracking. Not all communications mechanisms support dynamic tracking; those that do not will default to static tracking.


### -field EffectiveOnly

Specifies whether the server may enable or disable <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/p-gly">privileges</a> and groups that the client's security context may include.
