# RtlCaptureStackBackTrace function


## -description

The <b>RtlCaptureStackBackTrace</b> routine captures a stack back trace by walking up the stack and recording the information for each frame.

## -parameters

### -param FramesToSkip [in]

The number of frames to skip from the start of the back trace.

### -param FramesToCapture [in]

The number of frames to be captured.

### -param BackTrace [out]

An array of pointers captured from the current stack trace.

### -param BackTraceHash [out, optional]

An optional value that can be used to organize hash tables. If this parameter is <b>NULL</b>, no hash value is computed.

This value is calculated based on the values of the pointers returned in the <i>BackTrace</i> array. Two identical stack traces will generate identical hash values.

## -returns

The number of captured frames.
