# RtlCaptureStackBackTrace function


## -description


The <b>RtlCaptureStackBackTrace</b> routine captures a stack back trace by walking up the stack and recording the information for each frame.


## -parameters




### -param FramesToSkip [in]

The number of frames to skip from the start of the back trace.


### -param FramesToCapture [in]

The number of frames to be captured. 


### -param BackTrace [out]

An array of pointers captured from the current stack trace.


### -param BackTraceHash [out, optional]

An optional value that can be used to organize hash tables. If this parameter is <b>NULL</b>, no hash value is computed.

This value is calculated based on the values of the pointers returned in the <i>BackTrace</i> array. Two identical stack traces will generate identical hash values.


## -returns



The number of captured frames.
