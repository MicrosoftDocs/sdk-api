# LDT_ENTRY structure


## -description


Describes an entry in the descriptor table. This structure is valid only on x86-based systems.


## -struct-fields




### -field LimitLow

The low-order part of the address of the last byte in the segment.


### -field BaseLow

The low-order part of the base address of the segment.


### -field HighWord

The high-order portion of the descriptor. This member may be interpreted as bytes or collections of bits, depending on the level of detail required. 



					


### -field HighWord.Bytes


### -field HighWord.Bytes.BaseMid

Middle bits (16â€“23) of the base address of the segment.


### -field HighWord.Bytes.Flags1

Values of the <b>Type</b>, <b>Dpl</b>, and <b>Pres</b> members in the <b>Bits</b> structure.


### -field HighWord.Bytes.Flags2

Values of the <b>LimitHi</b>, <b>Sys</b>, <b>Reserved_0</b>, <b>Default_Big</b>, and <b>Granularity</b> members in the <b>Bits</b> structure.


### -field HighWord.Bytes.BaseHi

High bits (24â€“31) of the base address of the segment.


### -field HighWord.Bits


### -field HighWord.Bits.BaseMid

The middle bits (16â€“23) of the base address of the segment.


### -field HighWord.Bits.Type

The type of segment. This member can be one of the following values:


### -field HighWord.Bits.Dpl

The privilege level of the descriptor. This member is an integer value in the range 0 (most privileged) through 3 (least privileged).


### -field HighWord.Bits.Pres

The present flag. This member is 1 if the segment is present in physical memory or 0 if it is not.


### -field HighWord.Bits.LimitHi

The high bits (16â€“19) of the address of the last byte in the segment.


### -field HighWord.Bits.Sys

The space that is available to system programmers. This member might be used for marking segments in some system-specific way.


### -field HighWord.Bits.Reserved_0

Reserved.


### -field HighWord.Bits.Default_Big

The size of segment. If the segment is a data segment, this member contains 1 if the segment is larger than 64 kilobytes (K) or 0 if the segment is smaller than or equal to 64K. 




If the segment is a code segment, this member contains 1 if the segment is a code segment and runs with the default (native mode) instruction set. This member contains 0 if the code segment is an 80286 code segment and runs with 16-bit offsets and the 80286-compatible instruction set.


### -field HighWord.Bits.Granularity

The granularity. This member contains 0 if the segment is byte granular, 1 if the segment is page granular.


### -field HighWord.Bits.BaseHi

The high bits (24â€“31) of the base address of the segment.


## -remarks



The 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getthreadselectorentry">GetThreadSelectorEntry</a> function fills this structure with information from an entry in the descriptor table. You can use this information to convert a segment-relative address to a linear virtual address.

The base address of a segment is the address of offset 0 in the segment. To calculate this value, combine the <b>BaseLow</b>, <b>BaseMid</b>, and <b>BaseHi</b> members.

The limit of a segment is the address of the last byte that can be addressed in the segment. To calculate this value, combine the <b>LimitLow</b> and <b>LimitHi</b> members.
