# PROCESSOR_POWER_POLICY_INFO structure


## -description


Contains information about processor C-state policy settings. This structure is part of the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winnt/ns-winnt-processor_power_policy">PROCESSOR_POWER_POLICY</a> structure.


## -struct-fields




### -field TimeCheck

The time that must expire before promotion or demotion is considered, in microseconds.


### -field DemoteLimit

The minimum amount of time that must be spent in the idle loop to avoid demotion, in microseconds.


### -field PromoteLimit

The time that must be exceeded to cause promotion to a deeper idle state, in microseconds.


### -field DemotePercent

The value that scales the threshold at which the power policy manager decreases the performance of the processor, expressed as a percentage.


### -field PromotePercent

The value that scales the threshold at which the power policy manager increases the performance of the processor, expressed as a percentage.


### -field Spare

Reserved.


### -field AllowDemotion

When set, allows the kernel power policy manager to demote from the current state.


### -field AllowPromotion

When set, allows the kernel power policy manager to promote from the current state.


### -field Reserved

Reserved.
