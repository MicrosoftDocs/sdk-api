# PROCESS_MITIGATION_SIDE_CHANNEL_ISOLATION_POLICY structure


## -description


This data structure provides the status of process policies that are related to the mitigation of side channels. This can include side channel attacks involving speculative execution and page combining.


## -struct-fields




### -field DUMMYUNIONNAME


### -field DUMMYUNIONNAME.Flags

This member is reserved for system use.


### -field DUMMYUNIONNAME.DUMMYSTRUCTNAME


### -field DUMMYUNIONNAME.DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.SmtBranchTargetIsolation

Prevent branch target pollution cross-SMT-thread in user mode.


### -field DUMMYUNIONNAME.DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.IsolateSecurityDomain

Isolate this process into a distinct security domain, even from other processes running as the same security context.  This
            prevents branch target injection cross-process.

Page combining is limited to processes within the same security
            domain.  This flag effectively limits the process to
             only combining internally to the process itself,
            except for common pages and unless further restricted by the
            <b>DisablePageCombine</b> policy.


### -field DUMMYUNIONNAME.DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.DisablePageCombine

Disable all page combining for this process, even internally to
             the process itself, except for common pages.


### -field DUMMYUNIONNAME.DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.SpeculativeStoreBypassDisable

Memory Disambiguation Disable.


### -field DUMMYUNIONNAME.DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.ReservedFlags

This member is reserved for system use.
