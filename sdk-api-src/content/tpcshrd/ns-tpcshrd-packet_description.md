# PACKET_DESCRIPTION structure


## -description

Describes the content of the packet for a particular tablet recognizer context.

Do not use this structure to access the data contained in a packet. This structure describes the content of the packet.

## -struct-fields

### -field cbPacketSize

The size, in bytes, of the packet data.

### -field cPacketProperties

The number of elements in the <i>pPacketProperties</i> array.

### -field pPacketProperties

An array of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/tpcshrd/ns-tpcshrd-packet_property">PACKET_PROPERTY</a> structures.

### -field cButtons

Deprecated. Do not use.

### -field pguidButtons

Deprecated. Do not use.

## -remarks

The <b>PACKET_DESCRIPTION</b> structure defines the logical layout of the packet. Typically, you do not need to address the contents of a packet. You pass the packets to the Ink object. However, if you need to address the contents of a packet, each packet contains a series of LONG values (properties) followed by one or more DWORD values (button states).
