# IWMPEffects::RenderFullScreen


## -description



The <b>RenderFullScreen</b> method renders the visualization in full-screen mode.




## -parameters




### -param pLevels [in]

Pointer to a <b>TimedLevel</b> structure.


## -returns



If the method succeeds, your implementation should return S_OK. If it fails, return an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



The <b>GoFullscreen</b> method must be called with a <b>True</b> value before <b>RenderFullScreen</b> can be called.

The user can enter or leave full screen mode by pressing the Alt and Enter keys simultaneously.

A default implementation of this method is not included in the visualization wizard.

If your implementation returns an error from this method, then <b>GoFullscreen</b>(<b>False</b>) will be called to ask your visualization to drop out of full screen mode.
