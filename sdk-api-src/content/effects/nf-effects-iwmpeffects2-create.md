# IWMPEffects2::Create


## -description

The <b>Create</b> method is called by Windows Media Player to instantiate a visualization window.

## -parameters

### -param hwndParent [in]

<b>HWND</b> handle to the parent window hosting the visualization window.

## -returns

This method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>.

## -remarks

A visualization that implements <b>IWMPEffects2</b> is rendered in its own window unless it will be displayed in a clipped device context, in which case it is rendered windowless. For a visualization that is rendered windowless, Windows Media Player calls this method with a <b>NULL</b> value for the <i>hwndParent</i> parameter. If your visualization does not support windowless mode (for example, when using Direct3D), it should return a failure <b>HRESULT</b> value. In this case, your visualization will not be available in skins that clip the display region.

If you create a visualization for Windows Media Player using the Direct3D® component of Microsoft DirectX®, you must set the <b>D3DCREATE_FPU_PRESERVE</b> flag when calling <b>IDirect3D8::CreateDevice</b>. Failure to set this flag for visualizations that use Direct3D may yield unexpected results.
