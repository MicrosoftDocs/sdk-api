# IFilter::GetText


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/search/-search-3x-wds-overview">Windows Search</a> for client side search and  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=18914">Microsoft Search Server Express</a> for server side search.]

Retrieves text (text-type properties) from the current chunk, which must have a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/filter/ne-filter-chunkstate">CHUNKSTATE</a> enumeration value of CHUNK_TEXT.



## -parameters




### -param pcwcBuffer [in, out]

On entry, the size of <i>awcBuffer</i> array in wide/Unicode characters. On exit, the number of Unicode characters written to <i>awcBuffer</i>.


### -param awcBuffer [out]

Text retrieved from the current chunk. Do not terminate the buffer with a character. Use a null-terminated string. The null-terminated string should not exceed the size of the destination buffer. 



## -returns



This method can return one of these values.

The <b>flags</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/filter/ns-filter-stat_chunk">STAT_CHUNK</a> structure for the current chunk does not have a value of CHUNK_TEXT.

<td width="60%">
All the text in the current chunk has been returned. Additional calls to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/filter/nf-filter-ifilter-gettext">GetText</a> method should return this error until the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/filter/nf-filter-ifilter-getchunk">IFilter::GetChunk</a> method has been called successfully. 


</td>

<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>FILTER_S_LAST_TEXT </b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
As an optimization, the last call that returns text can return FILTER_S_LAST_TEXT, indicating that the next call to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/filter/nf-filter-ifilter-gettext">GetText</a> method will return FILTER_E_NO_MORE_TEXT. This optimization can save time by eliminating unnecessary calls to <b>GetText</b>.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



If the current chunk is too large for the <i>awcBuffer</i> array, more than one call to the <b>GetText</b> method can be required to retrieve all the text in the current chunk. Each call to the <b>GetText</b> method retrieves text that immediately follows the text from the last call to the <b>GetText</b> method. The last character from one call can be in the middle of a word, and the first character in the next call would continue that word. Search engines must handle this situation.
