# IFilter::GetChunk


## -description

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](/windows/desktop/search/-search-3x-wds-overview) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=18914) for server side search.

Positions the filter at the beginning of the next chunk, or at the first chunk if this is the first call to the <b>GetChunk</b> method, and returns a description of the current chunk.

## -parameters

### -param pStat [out]

A pointer to a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/filter/ns-filter-stat_chunk">STAT_CHUNK</a> structure containing a description of the current chunk.

## -returns

This method can return one of these values.

## -remarks

If upon return <i>pStat</i> points to a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/filter/ns-filter-stat_chunk">STAT_CHUNK</a> structure with the <b>breakType</b> member equal to CHUNK_NO_BREAK, only the <b>idChunk</b> member will be updated with the new chunk identifier (ID) value. The other members of the <b>STAT_CHUNK</b> structure remain unchanged. 



Internal value-type properties (chunks with a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/filter/ne-filter-chunkstate">CHUNKSTATE</a> enumeration value of CHUNK_VALUE) cannot be concatenated using CHUNK_NO_BREAK. A single word cannot span more than two glued chunks. 



Chunk ID zero is invalid.



Before the <b>GetChunk</b> method is called for the first time, there is no current chunk. After an error return code of anything other than FILTER_E_END_OF_CHUNKS the next call to the <b>GetChunk</b> method nevertheless retrieves the next chunk after the unavailable one.



<h3><a id="Notes_to_Callers"></a><a id="notes_to_callers"></a><a id="NOTES_TO_CALLERS"></a>Notes to Callers</h3>
When the <b>GetChunk</b> method finishes, the chunk described in *<i>pStat</i> is the current chunk. The chunk descriptor is owned by the routine calling the <b>GetChunk</b> method, but the property name pointer, which can be set in the property specification, is owned by the <b>GetChunk</b> method and should not be freed. 



<h3><a id="Notes_to_Implementers_"></a><a id="notes_to_implementers_"></a><a id="NOTES_TO_IMPLEMENTERS_"></a>Notes to Implementers
</h3>
If a call to the <b>GetChunk</b> method of the content filter of a linked or embedded object returns FILTER_E_END_OF_CHUNKS, the implementation should return the next chunk of the linking or embedding object. For example, if a document has two embedded objects and the first has returned FILTER_E_END_OF_CHUNKS, then the outer content filter must call the <b>GetChunk</b> method of the content filter for the embedded object.



Before returning the results of a call to the <b>GetChunk</b> method on an embedded or linked object, check to make sure that the chunk ID is unique. If not, the implementer must renumber the chunk and keep a mapping of the new chunk ID.
