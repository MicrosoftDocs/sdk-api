# FILTERREGION structure


## -description

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](/windows/desktop/search/-search-3x-wds-overview) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=18914) for server side search.

Describes the position and extent of a specified portion of text within an object.

## -struct-fields

### -field idChunk

The chunk identifier.

### -field cwcStart

The beginning of the region, specified as an offset from the beginning of the chunk.

### -field cwcExtent

The extent of the region, specified as the number of Unicode characters.

## -remarks

The <b>cwcExtent</b> member might specify a number of characters (starting from a position the <b>cwcStart</b> member specifies) that extends beyond the end of the chunk. In that case, the region should be continued into the next chunk, which should have the same attribute as the current region.
