## -description

> [!Note]  
> Indexing Service is no longer supported as of Windows XP and is unavailable for use as of Windows 8. Instead, use [Windows Search](/windows/desktop/search/-search-3x-wds-overview) for client side search and [Microsoft Search Server Express](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=18914) for server side search.

Retrieves an interface representing the specified portion of object. Currently reserved for future use.

### -param ppunk [out]

A pointer to a variable that receives the interface pointer requested in <i>riid</i>. Upon successful return, *<i>ppunk</i> contains the requested interface pointer.

## -remarks

If it is impossible for the <b>BindRegion</b> method to bind an interface to the specified region, return FILTER_W_REGION_CLIPPED. This situation can occur when the next such chunk is in a linked object or an embedded object. 



Not all filters are capable of supporting the <b>BindRegion</b> method in a rational way. Filters that are implemented by viewing applications will benefit the most from this method. The method is intended to be a way to pass cookies through the search engine and back to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/filter/nn-filter-ifilter">IFilter</a> interface implementation.

This method is currently reserved for future use. Always return E_NOTIMPL.
