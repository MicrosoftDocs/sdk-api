# IRelationship::IsReal


## -description


Reports whether a relationship is real.


## -parameters




### -param pIsReal [out, retval]

Type: <b>BOOL*</b>

Receives <b>TRUE</b> for a real relationship; otherwise, <b>FALSE</b>.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



A relationship is not considered real if its source entity derives from an entity
        that has a relationship of the same name. The purpose of such a "shadow" relationship
        is to store metadata specific to the inherited relationship.
