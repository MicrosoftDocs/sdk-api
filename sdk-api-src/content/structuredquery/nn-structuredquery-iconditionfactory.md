## -description

Provides methods for creating or resolving a condition tree that was obtained by parsing a query string.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IConditionFactory</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IConditionFactory</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

The <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-classic-samples/tree/master/Samples/Win7Samples/winui/WindowsSearch/StructuredQuerySample">StructuredQuerySample</a> demonstrates how to read lines from the console, parse them using the system schema, and display the resulting condition trees.
