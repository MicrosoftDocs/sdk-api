# IConditionFactory interface


## -description


Provides methods for creating or resolving a condition tree that was obtained by parsing a query string.


## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IConditionFactory</b> interface inherits from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IConditionFactory</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -members

The <b>IConditionFactory</b> interface has these methods.

</td>
<td align="left" width="63%">
Performs a variety of transformations on a condition tree, including the following: resolves conditions with relative date/time expressions to conditions with absolute date/time (as a VT_FILETIME); turns other recognized named entities into condition trees with actual values; simplifies condition trees; replaces virtual or compound properties with OR trees of other properties; removes condition trees resulting from queries with property keywords that had no condition applied.

## -remarks


The <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-classic-samples/tree/master/Samples/Win7Samples/winui/WindowsSearch/StructuredQuerySample">StructuredQuerySample</a> demonstrates how to read lines from the console, parse them using the system schema, and display the resulting condition trees.
