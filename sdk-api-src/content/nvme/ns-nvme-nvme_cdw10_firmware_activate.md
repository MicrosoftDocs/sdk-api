# NVME_CDW10_FIRMWARE_ACTIVATE structure


## -description

Contains parameters used in the Firmware Commit command.

The Firmware Commit command is used to verify that a valid firmware image has been downloaded and to commit that revision to a specific firmware slot.

> [!NOTE]
> The Firmware Commit command was called Firmware Activate in previous versions of NVM Express.

This structure is used as the value of the **CDW10** parameter in the **FIRMWAREACTIVATE** field of the [Command](ns-nvme-nvme_command.md) structure. All other command specific fields are reserved.
