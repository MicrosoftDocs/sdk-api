# NVME_CSTS_SHST_SHUTDOWN_STATUS enumeration

## -description

Contains values that indicate the status of shutdown processing that is initiated by the host setting the **SHN** field in the [NVME_CONTROLLER_CONFIGURATION](ns-nvme-nvme_controller_configuration.md) structure.

## -enum-fields

### -field NVME_CSTS_SHST_NO_SHUTDOWN

Normal operation (no shutdown has been requested).

### -field NVME_CSTS_SHST_SHUTDOWN_IN_PROCESS

Shutdown processing is occurring.

### -field NVME_CSTS_SHST_SHUTDOWN_COMPLETED

Shutdown processing is complete.

## -remarks

To start executing commands on the controller after a shutdown operation, (when the **SHST** field of the [NVME_CONTROLLER_STATUS](ns-nvme-nvme_controller_status.md) structure is set to `10b`, a Controller Reset (setting the **EN** field in [NVME_CONTROLLER_CONFIGURATION](ns-nvme-nvme_controller_configuration.md) to `0`) is required. If the host software submits commands to the controller without issuing a reset, the behavior is undefined.
