The **AWUPF** value must be less than or equal to the **AWUN** value.

If a write command is submitted with size less than or equal to the **AWUPF** value, the host is guaranteed that the write is atomic to the NVM with respect to other read or write commands. If a write command is submitted that is greater than this size, there is no guarantee of command atomicity. If the write size is less than or equal to the **AWUPF** value and the write command fails, then subsequent read commands for the associated logical blocks will return data from the previous successful write command.

If a write command is submitted with size greater than the **AWUPF** value, then there is no guarantee of data returned on subsequent reads of the associated logical blocks.

A reserved field.

### -field ACWU

Indicates the size of the write operation guaranteed to be written atomically to the NVM across all namespaces with any supported namespace format for a Compare and Write fused operation.

If a specific namespace guarantees a larger size than is reported in this field, then this namespace specific size is reported in the **NACWU** field in the [Identify Namespace](ns-nvme-nvme_identify_namespace_data.md) data structure.

This field will be supported if the Compare and Write fused command is supported. This field is specified in logical blocks and is a 0’s based value. If a Compare and Write is submitted that requests a transfer size larger than this value, the controller may fail the command with a status of [NVME_STATUS_INVALID_FIELD_IN_COMMAND](ne-nvme-nvme_status_generic_command_codes.md).

### -field SGLS.ByteAlignedContiguousPhysicalBuffer

When this value is set to `1`, the use of a byte aligned contiguous physical buffer of metadata (the Metadata Pointer field in Figure 12) is supported. When this value is cleared to `0`, the use of a byte aligned contiguous physical buffer of metadata is not supported.

### -field SGLS.SGLLengthLargerThanDataLength

When this value is set to `1`, the controller supports commands that contain a data or metadata SGL of a length larger than the amount of data to be
transferred. When this value is cleared to `0`, the SGL length will be equal to the amount of data to be transferred.

### -field SGLS.Reserved1

A reserved field.

### -field Reserved5

Bytes 540:703 are reserved.

### -field Reserved6

Bytes 704:2047 are reserved for I/O Command Set Attributes.

### -field PDS

Contains an array of 32 Power State Descriptors. Each member of the array is a 32 bit field that indicates the characteristics of a Power State Descriptor. The format of this field is defined in the [NVME_POWER_STATE_DESC](ns-nvme-nvme_power_state_desc.md) structure.

The zero-based position of a structure in the array corresponds to the name of the Power State Descriptor, such that Power State 0 Descriptor (PSD0) is in position 0, Power State 1 Descriptor (PSD1) is in position 1, and so on, up to Power State 31 Descriptor (PSD31) in position 31.

### -field VS

Bytes 3072:4095 are allocated for vendor specific usage.

## -remarks

The values of the **VID**, **SN**, and **MN** fields may be combined to form a globally unique value that identifies the NVM subsystem.
