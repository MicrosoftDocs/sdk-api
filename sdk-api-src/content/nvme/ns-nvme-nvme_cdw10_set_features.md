# NVME_CDW10_SET_FEATURES structure

## -description

Contains parameters for the Set Features command that sets the attributes of the specified feature.

The Set Features command uses the **NVME_CDW10_SET_FEATURES** structure in the **CDW10** parameter of the **SETFEATURES** field of the [Command](ns-nvme-nvme_command.md) structure.

## -struct-fields

### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME

### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.FID

Specifies an [NVME_FEATURES](ne-nvme-nvme_features.md) value that identifies the feature for which attributes are being provided.

### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.Reserved0

### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.SV

Specifies that the controller will save the attribute so that the attribute persists through all power states and resets.

The controller indicates in bit 4 of the Optional NVM Command Support **ONCS** field of the [Identify Controller](ns-nvme-nvme_identify_controller_data.md) data structure whether this field is supported.

If the **FID** specified in the Set Features command is not saveable by the controller and the controller receives a Set Features command with the Save **SV** bit set to one, then the command is aborted with a status of [Feature Identifer Not Saveable **NVME_STATUS_FEATURE_ID_NOT_SAVEABLE**](ne-nvme-nvme_status_command_specific_codes.md).
