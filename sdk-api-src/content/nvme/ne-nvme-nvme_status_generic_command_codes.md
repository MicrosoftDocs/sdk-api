# NVME_STATUS_GENERIC_COMMAND_CODES enumeration

## -description

Contains values that indicate a status associated with the command that is generic across many different types of commands.

These status codes are of the **NVME_STATUS_TYPE_GENERIC_COMMAND** [Status Code Type](ne-nvme-nvme_status_types.md) and are posted by the controller in a [Completion Queue entry](ns-nvme-nvme_completion_entry.md) when a command is completed. The codes indicate that the command specified by the Command and Submission Queue identifiers in the completion queue entry has completed.

## -enum-fields

### -field NVME_STATUS_SUCCESS_COMPLETION

The command completed successfully.

### -field NVME_STATUS_INVALID_COMMAND_OPCODE

The associated command opcode field is not valid.

### -field NVME_STATUS_INVALID_FIELD_IN_COMMAND

An invalid or unsupported field is specified in the command parameters.

### -field NVME_STATUS_COMMAND_ID_CONFLICT

The command identifier is already in use.

> [!NOTE]
> The number of commands that are searched for an ID conflict is implementation specific.

### -field NVME_STATUS_DATA_TRANSFER_ERROR

Indicates an error transferring the data or metadata associated with a command.

### -field NVME_STATUS_COMMAND_ABORTED_DUE_TO_POWER_LOSS_NOTIFICATION

Indicates that the command was aborted due to a power loss notification.

### -field NVME_STATUS_INTERNAL_DEVICE_ERROR

The command was not completed successfully due to an internal error. Details on the internal device error are returned as an asynchronous event.

### -field NVME_STATUS_COMMAND_ABORT_REQUESTED

The command was aborted due to a Command Abort command being received that specified the Submission Queue Identifier and Command Identifier of this command.

### -field NVME_STATUS_COMMAND_ABORTED_DUE_TO_SQ_DELETION

The command was aborted due to a Delete I/O Submission Queue request received for the Submission Queue to which the command was submitted.

### -field NVME_STATUS_COMMAND_ABORTED_DUE_TO_FAILED_FUSED_COMMAND

The command was aborted due to the other command in a fused operation failing.

### -field NVME_STATUS_COMMAND_ABORTED_DUE_TO_FAILED_MISSING_COMMAND

The command was aborted due to the companion fused command not being found as the subsequent Submission Queue entry.

### -field NVME_STATUS_INVALID_NAMESPACE_OR_FORMAT

The namespace or the format of that namespace is invalid.

### -field NVME_STATUS_COMMAND_SEQUENCE_ERROR

The command was aborted due to a protocol violation in a multi-command sequence. For example, a violation of the Security Send and Security Receive sequencing rules in the TCG Storage Synchronous Interface Communications protocol.

### -field NVME_STATUS_INVALID_SGL_LAST_SEGMENT_DESCR

The command includes an invalid SGL Last Segment or SGL Segment descriptor. This may occur when the SGL segment pointed to by an SGL Last Segment descriptor contains an SGL Segment descriptor or an SGL Last Segment descriptor or an SGL Segment descriptor. This may occur when an SGL Last Segment descriptor contains an invalid length (for example, a length of zero or one that is not a multiple of 16).

### -field NVME_STATUS_INVALID_NUMBER_OF_SGL_DESCR

There is an SGL Last Segment descriptor or an SGL Segment descriptor in a location other than the last descriptor of a segment based on the length indicated.

### -field NVME_STATUS_DATA_SGL_LENGTH_INVALID

This may occur if the length of a Data SGL is too short. This may occur if the length of a Data SGL is too long and the controller does not support SGL transfers longer than the amount of data to be transferred as indicated in the SGL Support (**SGLS**) field of the [Identify Controller (NVME_IDENTIFY_CONTROLLER_DATA)](ns-nvme-nvme_identify_controller_data.md) data structure.

### -field NVME_STATUS_METADATA_SGL_LENGTH_INVALID

This may occur if the length of a Metadata SGL is too short. This may occur if the length of a Metadata SGL is too long and the controller does not support SGL transfers longer than the amount of data to be transferred as indicated in the SGL Support (**SGLS**) field of the [Identify Controller (NVME_IDENTIFY_CONTROLLER_DATA)](ns-nvme-nvme_identify_controller_data.md) data structure.

### -field NVME_STATUS_SGL_DESCR_TYPE_INVALID

The type of an SGL Descriptor is a type that is not supported by the controller.

### -field NVME_STATUS_INVALID_USE_OF_CONTROLLER_MEMORY_BUFFER

The attempted use of the Controller Memory Buffer is not supported by the controller.

### -field NVME_STATUS_PRP_OFFSET_INVALID

The Offset field for a PRP entry is invalid. This may occur when there is a PRP entry with a non-zero offset after the first entry.

### -field NVME_STATUS_ATOMIC_WRITE_UNIT_EXCEEDED

The length specified exceeds the atomic write unit size.

### -field NVME_STATUS_OPERATION_DENIED

The command was denied due to lack of access rights.           

### -field NVME_STATUS_SGL_OFFSET_INVALID

The offset specified in a descriptor is invalid.

### -field NVME_STATUS_RESERVED

Reserved.

### -field NVME_STATUS_HOST_IDENTIFIER_INCONSISTENT_FORMAT

The NVM subsystem detected the simultaneous use of 64-bit and 128-bit Host Identifier values on different controllers. 

### -field NVME_STATUS_KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT_EXPIRED

The Keep Alive Timer expired.

### -field NVME_STATUS_KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT_INVALID

The Keep Alive Timeout value specified is invalid.

### -field NVME_STATUS_COMMAND_ABORTED_DUE_TO_PREEMPT_ABORT

The command was aborted due to a Reservation Acquire command with the Reservation Acquire Action (RACQA) set to 010b (Preempt and Abort).

### -field NVME_STATUS_SANITIZE_FAILED

The most recent sanitize operation failed and no recovery action has been successfully completed.

### -field NVME_STATUS_SANITIZE_IN_PROGRESS

The requested function (e.g., command) is prohibited while a sanitize operation is in progress. 

### -field NVME_STATUS_SGL_DATA_BLOCK_GRANULARITY_INVALID

The Address alignment or Length granularity for an SGLData Block descriptor is invalid.

### -field NVME_STATUS_NVM_LBA_OUT_OF_RANGE

The command references an LBA that exceeds the size of the namespace.

### -field NVME_STATUS_NVM_CAPACITY_EXCEEDED

Execution of the command has caused the capacity of the namespace to be exceeded. This error occurs when the Namespace Utilization exceeds the Namespace Capacity.

### -field NVME_STATUS_NVM_NAMESPACE_NOT_READY

The namespace is not ready to be accessed. The Do Not Retry bit indicates whether re-issuing the command at a later time may succeed.

### -field NVME_STATUS_NVM_RESERVATION_CONFLICT

The command was aborted due to a conflict with a reservation held on the accessed namespace.

### -field NVME_STATUS_FORMAT_IN_PROGRESS

The namespace is currently being formatted. The Do Not Retry bit will be cleared to ‘0’ to indicate that the command may succeed if it is resubmitted.
