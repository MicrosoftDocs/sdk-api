Indicates the number of I/O Submission Queues requested by the host. This number does not include the Admin Submission Queue. A minimum of one should be requested, reflecting that the minimum support is for one I/O Submission Queue. This is a 0’s based value.

The maximum value that may be specified is 65,534 (indicating 65,535 I/O Submission Queues).

If the specified value specified is greater than the maximum value, the controller will return a status of [NVME_STATUS_INVALID_FIELD_IN_COMMAND](ne-nvme-nvme_status_generic_command_codes.md).

### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.NCQ
