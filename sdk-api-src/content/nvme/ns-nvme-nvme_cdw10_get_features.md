# NVME_CDW10_GET_FEATURES structure

## -description

Contains parameters for the Get Features command that retrieves the attributes of the specified feature.

The Get Features command uses the **NVME_CDW10_GET_FEATURES** structure in the **CDW10** parameter of the **GETFEATURES** field of the [Command](ns-nvme-nvme_command.md) structure.

## -struct-fields

### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME

### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.FID

Specifies an [NVME_FEATURES](ne-nvme-nvme_features.md) value that identifies the feature for which to provide data.

### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.SEL

Specifies an [NVME_FEATURE_VALUE_CODES](ne-nvme-nvme_feature_value_codes.md) value that indicates which value of the attributes to return in the provided data.

The controller indicates in bit 4 of the Optional NVM Command Support **ONCS** field of the [Identify Controller](ns-nvme-nvme_identify_controller_data.md) data structure whether the **SEL** field is supported.

If a Get Features command is received with the **SEL**** field set to `010b` (**NVME_FEATURE_VALUE_SAVED**), for example, and the controller does not support the Feature Identifier being saved or does not currently have any saved values, then the controller treats the **SEL** field as though it were set to `001b` (**NVME_FEATURE_VALUE_DEFAULT**).
