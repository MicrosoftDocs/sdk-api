# NVME_IDENTIFY_NAMESPACE_DATA structure

## -description

Contains values that indicate capabilities and settings that are specific to a particular namespace.

The capabilities and settings that are common to all namespaces are contained in the **NVME_IDENTIFY_NAMESPACE_DATA** data structure for the namespace with the Namespace Identifier of `0xFFFFFFFF`.

The **nvme.h** header file defines the constant **NVME_NAMESPACE_ALL** with a value of `0xFFFFFFFF`.

If the controller supports Namespace Management and the Namespace Identifier (**NSID**) field of the [NVME_COMMAND](ns-nvme-nvme_command.md) structure is set to **NVME_NAMESPACE_ALL**, the controller returns an **NVME_IDENTIFY_NAMESPACE_DATA** data structure that specifies capabilities that are common across all namespaces.

## -struct-fields

### -field NSZE

Indicates the total size of the namespace in logical blocks.

A namespace of size *n* consists of Logical Block Address (LBA) `0` through `(n - 1)`. The number of logical blocks is based on the formatted LBA size. This field is undefined prior to the namespace being formatted.

### -field NCAP

Indicates the maximum number of logical blocks that may be allocated in the namespace at any point in time.

The number of logical blocks is based on the formatted LBA size. This field is undefined prior to the namespace being formatted.

The **NCAP** field is used in the case of thin provisioning and reports a value that is smaller than or equal to the Namespace Size (**NSZE**).

Spare LBAs are not reported as part of this field. A value of `0h` for the Namespace Capacity (**NCAP**) indicates that the namespace ID is an inactive namespace ID. A logical block is allocated when it is written with a Write or Write Uncorrectable command. A logical block may be deallocated using the [Dataset Management](ns-nvme-nvme_command.md#-field-u.datasetmanagement) command.

### -field NUSE

Indicates the current number of logical blocks allocated in the namespace.

The value of this field is smaller than or equal to the value of the Namespace Capacity **NCAP** field.

The number of logical blocks is based on the formatted LBA size. When using the NVM command set: A logical block is allocated when it is written with a Write or Write Uncorrectable command. A logical block may be deallocated using the [Dataset Management](ns-nvme-nvme_command.md#-field-u.datasetmanagement) command.

A controller may report a **NUSE** value equal to an **NCAP** value at all times if the product is not targeted for thin provisioning environments.

### -field NSFEAT

A Namespace Features (NSFEAT) structure containing fields that define features of the namespace.

### -field NSFEAT.ThinProvisioning

Bit 0 of the **NSFEAT** structure indicates whether the namespace supports thin provisioning.

When this value is set to `1`, the namespace supports thin provisioning. Specifically, the Namespace Capacity (**NCAP**) reported may be less than the Namespace Size (**NSZE**). When this feature is supported and the Dataset Management command is supported, then deallocating LBAs will be reflected in the Namespace Utilization (**NUSE**) field.

When this value is cleared to `0`, it indicates that thin provisioning is not supported and the **NSZE** and **NCAP** fields report the same value.

### -field NSFEAT.NameSpaceAtomicWriteUnit

Bit 1 of the **NSFEAT** structure indicates whether Namespace Atomic Boundary Parameters are defined for this namespace.

When this value is set to `1`, the fields **NAWUN**, **NAWUPF**, and **NACWU** are defined for this namespace and should be used by the host for this namespace instead of the **AWUN**, **AWUPF**, and **ACWU** fields in the [Identify Controller](ns-nvme-nvme_identify_controller_data.md) data structure.

When this value is cleared to `0`, the controller does not support the fields **NAWUN**, **NAWUPF**, and **NACWU** for this namespace. In this case, the host should use the **AWUN**, **AWUPF**, and **ACWU** fields defined in the [Identify Controller](ns-nvme-nvme_identify_controller_data.md) data structure.

### -field NSFEAT.DeallocatedOrUnwrittenError

Bit 2 of the **NSFEAT** structure indicates whether the controller supports the Deallocated or Unwritten Logical Block error for this namespace.

When this value is set to `1`, the controller supports the [Deallocated or Unwritten Logical Block (**NVME_STATUS_NVM_DEALLOCATED_OR_UNWRITTEN_LOGICAL_BLOCK**)](ne-nvme-nvme_status_media_error_codes.md) error for this namespace. When this value is cleared to `0`, the controller does not support the **NVME_STATUS_NVM_DEALLOCATED_OR_UNWRITTEN_LOGICAL_BLOCK** error for this namespace.

### -field NSFEAT.SkipReuseUI

Bit 3 of the **NSFEAT** structure is a setting for the Skip Reuse UI feature.

### -field NSFEAT.Reserved

Bits 4:7 of the **NSFEAT** structure are reserved.

### -field NLBAF

Defines the number of supported LBA data size and metadata size combinations supported by the namespace.

LBA formats are allocated in order (starting with 0) and packed sequentially. This is a 0’s based value. The maximum number of LBA formats that may be indicated as supported is 16.

The supported LBA formats are indicated in  the **LBAF** field (bytes 128 – 191 of this data structure). The metadata may be either transferred as part of the LBA (creating an extended LBA which is a larger LBA size that is exposed to the application) or it may be transferred as a separate contiguous buffer of data. The metadata cannot be split between the LBA and a separate metadata buffer.

It is recommended that software and controllers transition to an LBA size that is 4KB or larger for ECC efficiency at the controller. If providing metadata, it is recommended that at least 8 bytes are provided per logical block to enable use with end-to-end data protection.

### -field FLBAS
