# CLIPOBJ structure


## -description


The CLIPOBJ structure describes the clip region used when drawing. 


## -struct-fields




### -field iUniq

Specifies a value that uniquely identifies the clip region. If <b>iUniq</b> is nonzero, the driver uses it as a cache identifier. This allows the driver to recognize a region after downloading and caching it. If the value is zero, the driver should not cache the region because the region will not be used again.


### -field rclBounds

Specifies a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/windef/ns-windef-rectl">RECTL</a> structure that bounds the part of the region that intersects the drawing. If <b>iDComplexity</b> is DC_RECT, then this is the clipping rectangle to be considered.


### -field iDComplexity

Specifies the complexity of the part of the region that intersects with the drawing. This member must be one of the following values:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DC_COMPLEX

</td>
<td>
The clip region must be enumerated.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DC_RECT

</td>
<td>
Clip to a single rectangle.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DC_TRIVIAL

</td>
<td>
Clipping need not be considered; draw the whole figure.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field iFComplexity

Specifies the complexity of the whole region. This value is used by the driver in deciding whether to cache the region. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winddi/nf-winddi-clipobj_cenumstart">CLIPOBJ_cEnumStart</a> can be called to determine the exact number of rectangles in the region. This member can be one of the following values:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
FC_COMPLEX

</td>
<td>
The region consists of more than four rectangles.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
FC_RECT

</td>
<td>
The region is a single rectangle.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
FC_RECT4

</td>
<td>
The region consists of, at most, four rectangles.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field iMode

Specifies how the region is stored by GDI. This can help the driver determine how to enumerate the region. This member can be one of the following values:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
TC_PATHOBJ

</td>
<td>
The region is stored as a path.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
TC_RECTANGLES

</td>
<td>
The region is stored as rectangles.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field fjOptions

Specifies clipping options. This member can be the following value:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
OC_BANK_CLIP

</td>
<td>
<b>Obsolete</b>. Indicates an engine callback for a banked device.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


## -remarks



The region, described by CLIPOBJ, can be enumerated as a series of rectangles.
