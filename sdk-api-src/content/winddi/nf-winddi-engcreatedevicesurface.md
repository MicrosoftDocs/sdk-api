# EngCreateDeviceSurface function


## -description


The <b>EngCreateDeviceSurface</b> function creates and returns a handle for a device surface that the driver will manage.


## -parameters




### -param dhsurf [in]

Device handle to the surface to be managed by the device. This handle is passed to the driver when a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winddi/ns-winddi-surfobj">SURFOBJ</a> structure is passed for input or output.


### -param sizl [in]

Specifies a SIZEL structure that contains the width and height of the surface to be created. The <b>cx</b> and <b>cy</b> members of this structure contain respectively, the surface's width and height, in pixels. A SIZEL structure is identical to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/windef/ns-windef-size">SIZE</a> structure.


### -param iFormatCompat

Specifies the compatible engine format of the device surface being created. This is used by GDI if a temporary buffer is needed to simulate a complicated drawing call.


## -returns



The return value is a handle that identifies the surface if the function is successful. Otherwise, it is zero, and an error code is logged.




## -remarks



The storage space for the surface can optionally be provided by the driver. The surface should be associated by using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winddi/nf-winddi-engassociatesurface">EngAssociateSurface</a>. The surface should be deleted when it is no longer needed by using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winddi/nf-winddi-engdeletesurface">EngDeleteSurface</a>.
