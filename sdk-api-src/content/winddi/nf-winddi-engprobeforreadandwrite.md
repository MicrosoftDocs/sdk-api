## -description


The <b>EngProbeForReadAndWrite</b> function probes a structure for read and write accessibility.


## -parameters




### -param Address [in, out]

Pointer to the structure to be probed.


### -param Length [in]

Specifies the length, in bytes, of the structure to be probed.


### -param Alignment [in]

Specifies the required alignment of the structure. This parameter is expressed as the number of bytes in the base data type. For example, an alignment of 1 indicates that <i>Address</i> be aligned on a BYTE boundary, 2 specifies alignment on a WORD boundary, and 4 specifies alignment on a DWORD boundary.

<b>EngProbeForReadAndWrite</b> causes an exception to be raised if the structure pointed to by <i>Address</i>:

<ul>
<li>
Does not have a base address that begins on an <i>alignment</i>-byte boundary.

</li>
<li>
Is not both read- and write-accessible.
