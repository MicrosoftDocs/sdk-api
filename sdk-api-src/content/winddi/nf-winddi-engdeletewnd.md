# EngDeleteWnd function


## -description

The <b>EngDeleteWnd</b> function deletes a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winddi/ns-winddi-wndobj">WNDOBJ</a> structure.

## -parameters

### -param pwo

Pointer to the WNDOBJ structure to be deleted.

## -returns

None

## -remarks

Because deleting a window object involves locking window resources, <b>EngDeleteWnd</b> should be called only in the context of the WNDOBJ_SETUP escape in <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winddi/nf-winddi-drvescape">DrvEscape</a>, or from an <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/">MCD</a> or <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/">ICD</a> escape.

A driver can call <b>EngDeleteWnd</b> to remove its WNDOBJ structure associated with a window regardless of whether the window continues to exist. This is useful when the driver is being dynamically unloaded by the system while the associated window still exists.
