# BRUSHOBJ_pvGetRbrush function


## -description


The <b>BRUSHOBJ_pvGetRbrush</b> function retrieves a pointer to the driver's realization of a specified brush.


## -parameters




### -param pbo

Pointer to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winddi/ns-winddi-brushobj">BRUSHOBJ</a> structure whose realization is requested.


## -returns



The return value is a pointer to the realized brush if the function is successful. If the brush cannot be realized, the return value is null and an error code is logged.




## -remarks



<b>BRUSHOBJ_pvGetRbrush</b> is called when the brush is a pattern brush that has not yet been realized; that is, it is called when the <b>iSolidColor</b> member of the BRUSHOBJ structure is 0xFFFFFFFF and the <b>pvRbrush</b> member is null.

If the brush has not been realized when <b>BRUSHOBJ_pvGetRbrush</b> is called, GDI calls the driver-supplied <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winddi/nf-winddi-drvrealizebrush">DrvRealizeBrush</a> function to obtain the driver's realization of the brush. As an acceleration, GDI caches this realization in the <b>pvRbrush</b> member of the BRUSHOBJ structure. Then, when an application reuses this brush for another drawing operation, the driver doesn't have to call <b>BRUSHOBJ_pvGetRbrush</b> again.
