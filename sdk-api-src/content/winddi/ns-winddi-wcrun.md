# WCRUN structure


## -description


The WCRUN structure describes a run of Unicode characters.


## -struct-fields




### -field wcLow

Specifies the first character in the run.


### -field cGlyphs

Specifies the count of characters in the run.


### -field phg

Pointer to an array of glyph handles that correspond to this run. If this member is <b>NULL</b>, then each character in this run can be converted to a glyph handle by a cast, as in the following example:


```
HGLYPH hg = (HGLYPH) wc;
```



## -remarks



GDI relies on the runs being arranged in increasing order by code points. A binary search is made through the list of runs.

The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winddi/ns-winddi-fd_glyphset">FD_GLYPHSET</a> structure contains a WCRUN structure as one of its members.
