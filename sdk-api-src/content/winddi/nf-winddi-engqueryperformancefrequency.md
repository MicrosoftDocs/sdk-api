# EngQueryPerformanceFrequency function


## -description

The <b>EngQueryPerformanceFrequency</b> function queries the frequency of the performance counter.

## -parameters

### -param pFrequency [out]

Pointer to a location that receives the performance counter frequency.

## -returns

None

## -remarks

The resolution of the timer is 1/<i>x</i>, where <i>x</i> is the value returned in the location to which <i>pFrequency</i> points. For example, if the value returned in <i>pFrequency</i> is 2 million, each tick is 1/2 millionth of a second. Each 1/<i>x</i> millionth increment of the count corresponds to one second of elapsed time.

A driver should call this routine sparingly. Frequent calls to <b>EngQueryPerformanceFrequency</b> can degrade the I/O performance for the calling driver and for the system as a whole.
