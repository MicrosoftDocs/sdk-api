# IFsrmFileGroup::get_Members


## -description

<p class="CCE_Message">[This method is supported for compatibility but it's recommended to use the 
    <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fsrm/fsrm-wmi-classes">FSRM WMI Classes</a> to manage FSRM. Please see the 
    <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fsrm/msft-fsrmfilegroup">MSFT_FSRMFileGroup</a> class.]

Retrieves or sets the filename patterns that determine the files that are included in the file 
    group.

This property is read/write.

## -parameters

## -remarks

A filename pattern is a string expression that defines a set of filenames. The expression may contain the 
    following wildcard characters: "*" and "?". The "*" wildcard 
    matches 0 or more characters and the "?" wildcard  matches exactly 1 character. For example, the 
    file name "example.cpp" matches the pattern "e*.cpp", 
    but not "e?.cpp". The filename "ex.cpp" would match 
    both patterns. Note that when the filename pattern is used to compare against a specific filename, the pattern 
    match is case-insensitive.


#### Examples

For an example, see
