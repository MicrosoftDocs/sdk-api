# EMI_CHANNEL_MEASUREMENT_DATA structure


## -description

The <b>EMI_MEASUREMENT_DATA</b> structure provides data about the current energy measurement and the time at which the measurement was taken.

## -struct-fields

### -field AbsoluteEnergy

The total accumulated energy in the units specified by the [EMI_METADATA](./ns-emi-emi_metadata_v1.md) struct returned by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/emi/ni-emi-ioctl_emi_get_metadata">IOCTL_EMI_GET_METADATA</a>. In <b>EMI_VERSION_V1</b>, the only supported unit is picowatt-hours.

### -field AbsoluteTime

The time at which the energy measurement was taken, in 100 ns intervals.

## -remarks

This structure is returned through a successful completion of an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/emi/ni-emi-ioctl_emi_get_measurement">IOCTL_EMI_GET_MEASUREMENT</a> IOCTL request.
