## -description

Specifies a state type for a shared service registry key.

## -enum-fields

### -field ServiceSharedRegistryPersistentState:0

Mutable, persistent service state. This state is readable and writeable by the service and by local administrators. This state persists across reboots and and OS updates.

## -remarks

All per-service registry state types have a lifetime that is scoped to the lifetime of the service installation.
Once the service is removed by calling [DeleteService](/windows/win32/api/winsvc/nf-winsvc-deleteservice) the registry state is deleted too.
