## -description

Specifies the type of a per-service state directory.

## -enum-fields

### -field ServiceDirectoryPersistentState

Mutable, persistent service state. This state is both readable and writeable by the service, and is inaccessible outside of the service. This state persists across reboots and and OS updates.

### -field ServiceDirectoryTypeMax

Reserved. Represents the maximum value of the enumeration.

## -remarks

All per-service state directory types have a lifetime that is scoped to the lifetime of the service installation.
Once the service is removed by calling [DeleteService](/windows/win32/api/winsvc/ne-winsvc-DeleteService) the state directories are deleted too.
