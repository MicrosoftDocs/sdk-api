## -description

Specifies the type of a per-service shared state directory.

## -enum-fields

### -field ServiceSharedDirectoryPersistentState:0

Mutable, persistent service state. This state is both readable and writeable by the service and by local administrators. This state persists across reboots and OS updates.

## -remarks

All per-service state directory types have a lifetime that is scoped to the lifetime of the service installation.
Once the service is removed by calling [DeleteService](/windows/win32/api/winsvc/nf-winsvc-deleteservice) the state directories are deleted too.
