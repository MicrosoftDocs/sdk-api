## -description

Specifies a state type for a service registry key.

## -enum-fields

### -field ServiceRegistryStateParameters:0

Immutable service state, populated by INF to the Parameters subkey.

### -field ServiceRegistryStatePersistent:1

Mutable, persistent service state. This state is both readable and writable by the service, and is inaccessible outside of the service. This state persists across reboots and OS updates.

### -field MaxServiceRegistryStateType:2

Reserved. Represents the maximum value of the enumeration.

## -remarks

All per-service registry state types have a lifetime that is scoped to the lifetime of the service installation.
Once the service is removed by calling [DeleteService](/windows/win32/api/winsvc/nf-winsvc-deleteservice) the registry state is deleted too.
