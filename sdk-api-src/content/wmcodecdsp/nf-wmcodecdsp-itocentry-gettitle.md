# ITocEntry::GetTitle


## -description


The <b>GetTitle</b> method retrieves the title, set by a previous call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wmcodecdsp/nf-wmcodecdsp-itocentry-settitle">SetTitle</a>, of the entry.


## -parameters




### -param pwTitleSize [in, out]

If <i>pwszTitle</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this is an output parameter that receives the size, in wide characters, of the buffer required to receive the title. If <i>pwszTitle</i> is not <b>NULL</b>, this is an input parameter that specifies the size, in wide characters, of the caller-allocated buffer pointed to by <i>pwszTitle</i>.


### -param pwszTitle [out]

<b>NULL</b>, or a pointer to a caller-allocated buffer that, on successful completion, receives the title. The title  is null-terminated.


## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>MF_E_BUFFERTOOSMALL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method returns this error code if <i>pwszTitle</i> is not <b>NULL</b> and the title, including its NULL terminator, is larger than the size specified by <i>pwTitleSize</i>. In that case, <i>pwTitleSize</i> serves as an output parameter and receives the size of the required buffer.
