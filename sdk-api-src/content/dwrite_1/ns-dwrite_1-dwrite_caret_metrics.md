# DWRITE_CARET_METRICS structure


## -description


The <b>DWRITE_CARET_METRICS</b> structure specifies the metrics for caret placement in a font.


## -struct-fields




### -field slopeRise

Vertical rise of the caret in font design units. Rise / Run yields the caret angle. Rise = 1 for perfectly upright fonts (non-italic).


### -field slopeRun

Horizontal run of the caret in font design units. Rise / Run yields the caret angle. Run = 0 for perfectly upright fonts (non-italic).


### -field offset

Horizontal offset of the caret, in font design units, along the baseline for good appearance. Offset = 0 for perfectly upright fonts (non-italic).
