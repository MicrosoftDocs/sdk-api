# DWRITE_VERTICAL_GLYPH_ORIENTATION enumeration


## -description


The <b>DWRITE_VERTICAL_GLYPH_ORIENTATION</b> enumeration contains values that specify the desired kind of glyph orientation for the text.


## -enum-fields




### -field DWRITE_VERTICAL_GLYPH_ORIENTATION_DEFAULT

The default glyph orientation. In vertical layout, naturally horizontal scripts (Latin, Thai, Arabic, Devanagari) rotate 90 degrees clockwise, while ideographic scripts (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) remain upright, 0 degrees.


### -field DWRITE_VERTICAL_GLYPH_ORIENTATION_STACKED

Stacked glyph orientation. Ideographic scripts and scripts that permit stacking (Latin, Hebrew) are stacked in vertical reading layout. Connected scripts (Arabic, Syriac, 'Phags-pa, Ogham), which would otherwise look broken if glyphs were kept at 0 degrees, remain connected and rotate.


## -remarks



The client specifies a <b>DWRITE_VERTICAL_GLYPH_ORIENTATION</b>-typed value to the analyzer as the desired orientation.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This is the client preference, and the constraints of the script determine the final presentation.</div>
<div> </div>
