# IDWriteFont1::GetPanose


## -description


Gets the PANOSE values from the font and is used for font selection and
    matching.


## -parameters




### -param panose [out]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite_1/ns-dwrite_1-dwrite_panose">DWRITE_PANOSE</a>*</b>

A pointer to the <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite_1/ns-dwrite_1-dwrite_panose">DWRITE_PANOSE</a> structure to fill in.


## -remarks



If the font has no PANOSE values,
    they are set to 'any' (0) and <a href="/windows/win32/DirectWrite/direct-write-portal">DirectWrite</a> doesn't simulate those values.
