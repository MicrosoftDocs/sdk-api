# IDWriteFontFace1::GetGdiCompatibleMetrics


## -description


Obtains design units and common metrics for the font face.
    These metrics are applicable to all the glyphs within a fontface and are used by applications for layout calculations.


## -parameters




### -param emSize

Type: <b>FLOAT</b>

The logical size of the font in DIP units.


### -param pixelsPerDip

Type: <b>FLOAT</b>

The number of physical pixels per DIP.


### -param transform [in, optional]

Type: <b>const <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/ns-dwrite-dwrite_matrix">DWRITE_MATRIX</a>*</b>

An optional transform applied to the glyphs and their positions. This transform is applied after the scaling specified by the font size and <i>pixelsPerDip</i>.


### -param fontMetrics [out]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite_1/ns-dwrite_1-dwrite_font_metrics1">DWRITE_FONT_METRICS1</a>*</b>

A pointer to a <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite_1/ns-dwrite_1-dwrite_font_metrics1">DWRITE_FONT_METRICS1</a> structure to fill in. The metrics returned by this function are in font design units.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

Standard HRESULT error code.
