# DWRITE_JUSTIFICATION_OPPORTUNITY structure


## -description


The <b>DWRITE_JUSTIFICATION_OPPORTUNITY</b> structure specifies justification info per glyph.


## -struct-fields




### -field expansionMinimum

Minimum amount of expansion to apply to the side of the glyph. This might vary from zero to infinity, typically being zero except for kashida.


### -field expansionMaximum

Maximum amount of expansion to apply to the side of the glyph. This might vary from zero to infinity, being zero for fixed-size characters and connected scripts, and non-zero for discrete scripts, and non-zero for cursive scripts at expansion points.


### -field compressionMaximum

Maximum amount of compression to apply to the side of the glyph. This might vary from zero up to the glyph cluster size.


### -field expansionPriority

Priority of this expansion point. Larger priorities are applied later, while priority zero does nothing.


### -field compressionPriority

Priority of this compression point. Larger priorities are applied later, while priority zero does nothing.


### -field allowResidualExpansion

Allow this expansion point to use up any remaining slack space even after all expansion priorities have been used up.


### -field allowResidualCompression

Allow this compression point to use up any remaining space even after all compression priorities have been used up.


### -field applyToLeadingEdge

Apply expansion and compression to the leading edge of the glyph. This bit is <b>FALSE</b> (0) for connected scripts, fixed-size characters, and diacritics. It is generally <b>FALSE</b> within a multi-glyph cluster, unless the script allows expansion of glyphs within a cluster, like Thai.


### -field applyToTrailingEdge

Apply expansion and compression to the trailing edge of the glyph. This bit is <b>FALSE</b> (0) for connected scripts, fixed-size characters, and diacritics. It is generally <b>FALSE</b> within a multi-glyph cluster, unless the script allows expansion of glyphs within a cluster, like Thai.


### -field reserved
