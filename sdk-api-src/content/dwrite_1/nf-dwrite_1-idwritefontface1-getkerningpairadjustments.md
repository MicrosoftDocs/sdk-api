# IDWriteFontFace1::GetKerningPairAdjustments


## -description

Retrieves the kerning pair adjustments from the font's kern table.

## -parameters

### -param glyphCount

Type: <b>UINT32</b>

Number of glyphs to retrieve adjustments for.

### -param glyphIndices [in]

Type: <b>const UINT16*</b>

An array of glyph id's to retrieve adjustments
    for.

### -param glyphAdvanceAdjustments [out]

Type: <b>INT32*</b>

The advances, returned in font design units, for
    each glyph. The last glyph adjustment is zero.

## -returns

Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

## -remarks

<b>GetKerningPairAdjustments</b> isn't a direct replacement for GDI's character based
    <a href="/windows/win32/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-getkerningpairsa">GetKerningPairs</a>, but it serves the same role, without the client
    needing to cache them locally. <b>GetKerningPairAdjustments</b> also uses glyph id's directly
    rather than UCS-2 characters (how the kern table actually stores
    them), which avoids glyph collapse and ambiguity, such as the dash
    and hyphen, or space and non-breaking space.

Newer fonts may have only GPOS kerning instead of the legacy pair-table kerning. Such fonts, like Gabriola, will only return 0's for
    adjustments. <b>GetKerningPairAdjustments</b> doesn't virtualize and flatten these
    GPOS entries into kerning pairs.

You can realize a performance benefit by calling <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite_1/nf-dwrite_1-idwritefontface1-haskerningpairs">IDWriteFontFace1::HasKerningPairs</a> to determine whether you need to call  <b>GetKerningPairAdjustments</b>. If you previously called <b>IDWriteFontFace1::HasKerningPairs</b> and it returned FALSE, you can avoid calling <b>GetKerningPairAdjustments</b> because the font has no kerning pair-table entries. That is, in this situation, a call to <b>GetKerningPairAdjustments</b> would be a no-op.
