## -description


Gets a font collection representing the set of EUDC (end-user defined characters) fonts.


## -parameters




### -param fontCollection [out]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritefontcollection">IDWriteFontCollection</a>**</b>

The font collection to fill.


### -param checkForUpdates

Type: <b>BOOL</b>

Whether to check for updates.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

Note that if no EUDC is set on the system,
    the returned collection will be empty, meaning it will return success
    but GetFontFamilyCount will be zero.
