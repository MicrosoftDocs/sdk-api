# CALLINFOCHANGE_CAUSE enumeration


## -description

The 
<b>CALLINFOCHANGE_CAUSE</b> enum is used by the

<a href="/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itcallinfo">ITCallInfo</a> interface. TAPI 2 applications use 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/tapi/nf-tapi-linegetcallinfo">lineGetCallInfo</a> or 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/tapi/nf-tapi-linegetcallstatus">lineGetCallStatus</a>.
