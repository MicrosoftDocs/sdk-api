## -remarks



Some service providers do not support this operation while streaming is active. The application may need to call 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-itstream-stopstream">ITStream::StopStream</a> or 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-itsubstream-stopsubstream">ITSubStream::StopSubStream</a> prior to the operation and 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-itstream-startstream">ITStream::StartStream</a> or 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-itsubstream-startsubstream">ITSubStream::StartSubStream</a> following completion of the operation.

With 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-itbasiccallcontrol-parkdirect">ParkDirect</a>, the application determines the address at which it wants to park the call. With nondirected park, the switch determines the address and provides this to the application. In either case, a parked call can be unparked by specifying this address.

The parked call enters the disconnected state after it has been successfully parked.

Some switches can remind the user after a call has been parked for some long amount of time. The application sees an offering call with a call reason set to reminder.

The application must use 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oleauto/nf-oleauto-sysfreestring">SysFreeString</a> to free the memory allocated for the <i>ppNonDirAddress</i> parameter.
