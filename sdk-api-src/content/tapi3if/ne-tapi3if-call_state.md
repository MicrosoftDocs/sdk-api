# CALL_STATE enumeration


## -description


The 
<b>CALL_STATE</b> enum is used by the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-itcallinfo-get_callstate">ITCallInfo::get_CallState</a> and 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-itcallstateevent-get_state">ITCallStateEvent::get_State</a> methods.


## -enum-fields




### -field CS_IDLE

The call has been created, but 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-itbasiccallcontrol-connect">Connect</a> has not been called yet. A call can never transition into the idle state. This is the initial state for both incoming and outgoing calls.


### -field CS_INPROGRESS


<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-itbasiccallcontrol-connect">Connect</a> has been called, and the service provider is working on making a connection. This state is valid only on outgoing calls. This message is optional, because a service provider may have a call transition directly to the connected state.


### -field CS_CONNECTED

Call has been connected to the remote end and communication can take place.


### -field CS_DISCONNECTED

Call has been disconnected. There are several causes for disconnection. See the table of valid call state transitions below.


### -field CS_OFFERING

A new call has appeared, and is being offered to an application. If the application has owner privileges on the call, it can either call 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-itbasiccallcontrol-answer">Answer</a> or 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-itbasiccallcontrol-disconnect">Disconnect</a> while the call is in the offering state. Current call privilege can be determined by calling 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-itcallinfo-get_privilege">ITCallInfo::get_Privilege</a>.


### -field CS_HOLD

The call is in the hold state.


### -field CS_QUEUED

The call is queued.


### -field CS_LASTITEM




## -remarks



Following is a table of all valid call state transitions.
