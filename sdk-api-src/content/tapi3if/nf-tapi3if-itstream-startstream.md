## -remarks



Streams start automatically as soon as a call is connected and ready to stream and a terminal is selected. Therefore, most applications do not need to call this method. Applications have to call this method only to start a stream that the application has previously stopped or paused by calling 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-itstream-stopstream">ITStream::StopStream</a> or 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-itstream-pausestream">ITStream::PauseStream</a>.

This call generates events that the application can retrieve if it has registered. Please see the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Tapi/events">Events</a> overview for information on receiving events.

If the stream starts successfully, the MSP fires a 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/ne-tapi3if-call_media_event">CALL_MEDIA_EVENT</a> with a value of CME_STREAM_ACTIVE event and 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/ne-tapi3if-call_media_event_cause">CALL_MEDIA_EVENT_CAUSE</a> equaling CMC_LOCAL_REQUEST.

If the stream fails to pause, the MSP fires a CME_STREAM_FAIL event with cause CMC_LOCAL_REQUEST.
