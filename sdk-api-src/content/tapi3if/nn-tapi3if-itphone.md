# ITPhone interface


## -description

The 
<b>ITPhone</b> interface is the main interface for the new Phone objects in the TAPI 3.1 object model. This interface allows access to the phone device at a level comparable to that available with the TAPI 2.<i>x</i> C API. The interface also allows the application to determine which addresses the phone is usable on, and to get a list of terminals associated with the phone. The 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-ienumphone-next">IEnumPhone::Next</a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-itphoneevent-get_phone">ITPhoneEvent::get_Phone</a> methods create the 
<b>ITPhone</b> interface.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">ITPhone</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oaidl/nn-oaidl-idispatch">IDispatch</a> interface. <b>ITPhone</b> also has these types of members:
