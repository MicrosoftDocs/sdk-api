## -parameters

### -param ppPhone [out]

<a href="/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itphone">ITPhone</a> interface.

## -returns

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.
