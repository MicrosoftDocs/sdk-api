# ITPhoneEvent::get_ButtonState


## -description


The 
<b>get_ButtonState</b> method returns a 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/ne-tapi3if-phone_button_state">PHONE_BUTTON_STATE</a> value specifying the state to which the button has transitioned. This information is available only when the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-itphoneevent-get_event">ITPhoneEvent::get_Event</a> method returns PE_BUTTON.


## -parameters




### -param pState [out]

Pointer to the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/ne-tapi3if-phone_button_state">PHONE_BUTTON_STATE</a> descriptor of the button's current state.


## -returns



If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



This method is available because some buttons do not support the PBS_DOWN button state, but instead momentarily report PBS_PRESSED. Additionally, the application can miss the button press on phones that do support PBS_DOWN if the button is pressed only for a short time and the call to the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-itphone-get_buttonstate">ITPhone::get_ButtonState</a> method does not execute quickly enough.
