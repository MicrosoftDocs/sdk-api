## -description

The 
<b>CALLINFO_LONG</b> enum is used by 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itcallinfo">ITCallInfo</a> methods that set and get call information of type <b>LONG</b>.

## -enum-fields

### -field CIL_MEDIATYPESAVAILABLE

The 
<a href="/windows/desktop/Tapi/tapimediatype--constants">media types</a> available on the call.

### -field CIL_BEARERMODE

The bearer mode of a call is described by the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/Tapi/linebearermode--constants">LINEBEARERMODE_ Constants</a>.

### -field CIL_CALLERIDADDRESSTYPE

The 
<a href="/windows/desktop/Tapi/lineaddresstype--constants">address type</a> of the caller.

### -field CIL_CALLEDIDADDRESSTYPE

The 
<a href="/windows/desktop/Tapi/lineaddresstype--constants">address type</a> of the called party.

### -field CIL_CONNECTEDIDADDRESSTYPE

The 
<a href="/windows/desktop/Tapi/lineaddresstype--constants">address type</a> of the connected party.

### -field CIL_REDIRECTIONIDADDRESSTYPE

The 
<a href="/windows/desktop/Tapi/lineaddresstype--constants">address type</a> of the destination to which a call has been redirected.

### -field CIL_REDIRECTINGIDADDRESSTYPE

The 
<a href="/windows/desktop/Tapi/lineaddresstype--constants">address type</a> of the location that redirected the call.

### -field CIL_ORIGIN

The origin of a call is described by the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/Tapi/linecallorigin--constants">LINECALLORIGIN_ Constants</a>, such as LINECALLORIGIN_EXTERNAL.

### -field CIL_REASON

The reason for a call is described by the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/Tapi/linecallreason--constants">LINECALLREASON_ Constants</a>, such as LINECALLREASON_FWDUNCOND.

### -field CIL_APPSPECIFIC

Application-specific information is used to pass information between applications in a multi-application environment. The information is not interpreted by the API implementation or the service provider. Only applications with owner privileges for the call can set it.

### -field CIL_CALLPARAMSFLAGS

Call parameter flags are described by 
<a href="/windows/desktop/Tapi/linecallparamflags--constants">LINECALLPARAMFLAGS_ Constants</a>, such as LINECALLPARAMFLAGS_BLOCKID. These flags are normally set during the creation of an outgoing call.

### -field CIL_CALLTREATMENT

Call treatment identifies how a call that is on hold or unanswered gets handled, and is described by 
<a href="/windows/desktop/Tapi/linecalltreatment--constants">LINECALLTREATMENT_ Constants</a>, such as LINECALLTREATMENT_MUSIC.

### -field CIL_MINRATE

The minimum rate for a call's data stream in bps (bits per second).

### -field CIL_MAXRATE

The maximum rate for a call's data stream in bps (bits per second).

### -field CIL_COUNTRYCODE

Country or region code.

### -field CIL_CALLID

Call identifier. Some service providers assign a unique code to each call.

### -field CIL_RELATEDCALLID

Call identifier for a call related to the current call, such as on a conference.

### -field CIL_COMPLETIONID

Completion identifier. The completion identifier is used to identify individual completion requests in progress. A completion identifier becomes invalid and can be reused after the request completion or after an outstanding request is canceled.

### -field CIL_NUMBEROFOWNERS

The number of applications having owner privileges for the current call.

### -field CIL_NUMBEROFMONITORS

The number of applications having monitor privileges for the current call.

### -field CIL_TRUNK

The trunk identifier for the current call.

### -field CIL_RATE

The current rate for a call's data stream in bps (bits per second).

### -field CIL_GENERATEDIGITDURATION

### -field CIL_MONITORDIGITMODES

### -field CIL_MONITORMEDIAMODES
