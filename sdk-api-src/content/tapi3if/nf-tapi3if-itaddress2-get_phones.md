# ITAddress2::get_Phones


## -description


The 
<b>get_Phones</b> method returns a VARIANT pointer to an 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itcollection">ITCollection</a> of phone objects corresponding to the phone devices that can be used with this address.

This method is intended for Visual Basic and scripting applications. C/C++ applications should use the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-itaddress2-enumeratephones">EnumeratePhones</a> method instead.


## -parameters




### -param pPhones [out]

Pointer to a VARIANT containing an 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itcollection">ITCollection</a> of 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itphone">ITPhone</a> interface pointers.


## -returns



If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



A phone device declares itself as being available on all addresses that support audio terminals by the TSP setting the PHONEFEATURE_GENERICPHONE bit in the <b>dwPhoneFeatures</b> member of the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi/ns-tapi-phonecaps">PHONECAPS</a> structure. A phone device can also declare itself as being preferred to an address or set of addresses by returning address/line IDs via 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi/nf-tapi-phonegetid">phoneGetID</a> with device class tapi/line. If no phones are available for use with the address, this method produces an empty collection and returns S_OK.

TAPI calls the <b>AddRef</b> method on the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itphone">ITPhone</a> interface returned by <b>ITAddress2::get_Phones</b>. The application must call <b>Release</b> on the 
<b>ITPhone</b> interface to free resources associated with it.
