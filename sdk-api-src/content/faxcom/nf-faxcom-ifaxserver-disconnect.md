# IFaxServer::Disconnect


## -description

The <b>IFaxServer::Disconnect</b> method terminates a fax client application's connection to a fax server.

## -parameters

## -returns

Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

## -remarks

A call to the <b>IFaxServer::Disconnect</b> method attempts to terminate a server connection made by a previous call to the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fax/-mfax-ifaxserver-connect-client-vb">IFaxServer::Connect</a> method.

In addition to calling the <b>IFaxServer::Disconnect</b> method, an application must also call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-release">IUnknown::Release</a> method to allow each object to deallocate itself.

For more information, see <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fax/-mfax-connecting-to-a-fax-server">Connecting to a Fax Server</a> and <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fax/-mfax-disconnecting-from-a-fax-server">Disconnecting from a Fax Server</a>.
