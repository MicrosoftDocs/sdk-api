# IFaxServer::get_ArchiveDirectory


## -description


The <b>IFaxServer::get_ArchiveDirectory</b> method retrieves the <b>ArchiveDirectory</b> property for a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fax/-mfax-faxserver-client">FaxServer</a> object. The <b>ArchiveDirectory</b> property is a null-terminated string that contains the location in which the fax server stores archived outbound faxes.

This property is read/write.


## -parameters


## -remarks



Set the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fax/-mfax-ifaxserver-get-archiveoutboundfaxes-vb">ArchiveOutboundFaxes</a> property to <b>TRUE</b> to archive faxes in the directory specified by the <b>ArchiveDirectory</b> property. The fax server must have access to the directory to successfully store outbound fax transmissions. 
		

The <b>get_ArchiveDirectory</b> method allocates the memory required for the buffer pointed to by the <i>pVal</i> parameter. The client application must call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oleauto/nf-oleauto-sysfreestring">SysFreeString</a> function to deallocate the resources associated with this parameter. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fax/-mfax-freeing-fax-resources">Freeing Fax Resources</a>.
