# GetSystemTimeAdjustmentPrecise function


## -description


Determines whether the system is applying periodic, programmed time adjustments to its time-of-day clock, and obtains the value and period of any such adjustments.


## -parameters




### -param lpTimeAdjustment [out]

Returns the adjusted clock update frequency.


### -param lpTimeIncrement [out]

Returns the clock update frequency.


### -param lpTimeAdjustmentDisabled [out]

Returns an indicator which specifies whether the time adjustment is enabled.

A value of <b>TRUE</b> indicates that periodic adjustment is disabled. In this case, the system may attempt to keep the time-of-day clock in sync using its own internal mechanisms. This may cause time-of-day to periodically jump to the "correct time."

A value of <b>FALSE</b> indicates that periodic, programmed time adjustment is being used to serialize time-of-day, and the system will not interfere or attempt to synchronize time-of-day on its own.


## -returns



If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero.

If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a>.




## -remarks



This function is used in algorithms that  synchronize the time-of-day with another time source, using a programmed clock adjustment. To do this, the system computes the adjusted clock update frequency, and then this function allows the caller to obtain that value.
