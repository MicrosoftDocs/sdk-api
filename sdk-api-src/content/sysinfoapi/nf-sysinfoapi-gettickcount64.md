# GetTickCount64 function


## -description

Retrieves the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since the system was started.



## -returns

The number of milliseconds.

## -remarks

The resolution of the <b>GetTickCount64</b> function is limited to the resolution of the system timer, which is typically in the range of  10 milliseconds to 16 milliseconds. The resolution of the <b>GetTickCount64</b> function is not affected by adjustments made by the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getsystemtimeadjustment">GetSystemTimeAdjustment</a> function.

If you need a higher resolution timer, use a 
<a href="/windows/desktop/Multimedia/multimedia-timers">multimedia timer</a> or a 
<a href="/windows/desktop/winmsg/about-timers">high-resolution timer</a>.

To obtain the time the system has spent in the working state since it was started, use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/realtimeapiset/nf-realtimeapiset-queryunbiasedinterrupttime">QueryUnbiasedInterruptTime</a> function. 

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/realtimeapiset/nf-realtimeapiset-queryunbiasedinterrupttime">QueryUnbiasedInterruptTime</a> function produces different results on debug ("checked") builds of Windows, because the interrupt-time count and tick count are advanced by approximately 49 days. This helps to identify bugs that might not occur until the system has been running for a long time. The checked build is available to MSDN subscribers through the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/default.aspx">Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)</a> Web site.</div>
<div> </div>
To compile an application that uses this function, define _WIN32_WINNT as 0x0600 or later. For more information, see <a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/using-the-windows-headers">Using the Windows Headers</a>.
