For example, if the DNS host name is "corporate-mail-server", the NetBIOS name would be "corporate-mail-".


### -field ComputerNameDnsHostname

The DNS name of the local computer or the cluster associated with the local computer.


### -field ComputerNameDnsDomain

The name of the DNS domain assigned to the local computer or the cluster associated with the local computer.


### -field ComputerNameDnsFullyQualified

The fully qualified DNS name that uniquely identifies the local computer or the cluster associated with the local computer. 




This name is a combination of the DNS host name and the DNS domain name, using the form <i>HostName</i>.<i>DomainName</i>.

### -field ComputerNamePhysicalNetBIOS

The NetBIOS name of the local computer. On a cluster, this is the NetBIOS name of the local node on the cluster.


### -field ComputerNamePhysicalDnsHostname

The DNS host name of the local computer. On a cluster, this is the DNS host name of the local node on the cluster.


### -field ComputerNamePhysicalDnsDomain

The name of the DNS domain assigned to the local computer. On a cluster, this is the DNS domain of the local node on the cluster.


### -field ComputerNamePhysicalDnsFullyQualified

The fully qualified DNS name that uniquely identifies the computer. On a cluster, this is the fully qualified DNS name of the local node on the cluster. The fully qualified DNS name is a combination of the DNS host name and the DNS domain name, using the form <i>HostName</i>.<i>DomainName</i>.
