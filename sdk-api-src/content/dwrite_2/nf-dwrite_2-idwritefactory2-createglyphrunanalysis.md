# IDWriteFactory2::CreateGlyphRunAnalysis


## -description


Creates a glyph run analysis object, which encapsulates information used to render a glyph run.


## -parameters




### -param glyphRun [in]

Type: <b>const <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/ns-dwrite-dwrite_glyph_run">DWRITE_GLYPH_RUN</a>*</b>

Structure specifying the properties of the glyph run.


### -param transform [in, optional]

Type: <b>const <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/ns-dwrite-dwrite_matrix">DWRITE_MATRIX</a>*</b>

Optional transform applied to the glyphs and their positions. This transform is applied after the
          scaling specified by the emSize and pixelsPerDip.


### -param renderingMode

Type: <b>DWRITE_RENDERING_MODE</b>

Specifies the rendering mode, which must be one of the raster rendering modes (i.e., not default
          and not outline).


### -param measuringMode

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dcommon/ne-dcommon-dwrite_measuring_mode">DWRITE_MEASURING_MODE</a></b>

Specifies the method to measure glyphs.


### -param gridFitMode

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite_2/ne-dwrite_2-dwrite_grid_fit_mode">DWRITE_GRID_FIT_MODE</a></b>

How to grid-fit glyph outlines. This must be non-default.


### -param antialiasMode

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite_1/ne-dwrite_1-dwrite_text_antialias_mode">DWRITE_TEXT_ANTIALIAS_MODE</a></b>

Specifies the antialias mode.


### -param baselineOriginX

Type: <b>FLOAT</b>

Horizontal position of the baseline origin, in DIPs.


### -param baselineOriginY

Type: <b>FLOAT</b>

Vertical position of the baseline origin, in DIPs.


### -param glyphRunAnalysis [out]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwriteglyphrunanalysis">IDWriteGlyphRunAnalysis</a>**</b>

Receives a pointer to the newly created object.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.
