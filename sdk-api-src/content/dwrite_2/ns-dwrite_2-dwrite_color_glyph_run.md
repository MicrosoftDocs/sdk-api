	 All coordinates are in device independent pixels (DIPs).


## -struct-fields




### -field glyphRun

Glyph run to draw for this layer.


### -field glyphRunDescription

Pointer to the glyph run description for this layer. This may be <b>NULL</b>. For example, when the original glyph run is split into multiple layers, one layer might have a description and the others have none.


### -field baselineOriginX

X coordinate of the baseline origin for the layer.


### -field baselineOriginY

Y coordinate of the baseline origin for the layer.


### -field runColor

Color value of the run; if all members are zero, the run should be drawn using the current brush.


### -field paletteIndex

Zero-based index into the font’s color palette; if this is <b>0xFFFF</b>, the run should be drawn using the current brush.
