# IWSDDeviceHost::Terminate


## -description

Terminates the host and releases any attached services. If a notification sink was passed to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wsdhost/nf-wsdhost-iwsddevicehost-start">Start</a> method, then the notification sink is released.

## -parameters

## -returns

Possible return values include, but are not limited to, the following:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Method completed successfully.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_FAIL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The host is uninitialized or the host has already been terminated.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## -remarks

Services and notification sinks will not receive messages after the <b>Terminate</b> method has completed.

If this device host was started by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wsdhost/nf-wsdhost-iwsddevicehost-start">IWSDDeviceHost::Start</a>, it must first be stopped by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wsdhost/nf-wsdhost-iwsddevicehost-stop">IWSDDeviceHost::Stop</a> before <b>Terminate</b> can be called.

	<b>Terminate</b> must be called before releasing the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wsdhost/nn-wsdhost-iwsddevicehost">IWSDDeviceHost</a>.
