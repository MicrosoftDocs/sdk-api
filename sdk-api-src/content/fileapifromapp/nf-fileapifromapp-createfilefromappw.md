## -description

Creates or opens a file or I/O device. The behavior of this function is identical to [**CreateFile**](../fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilew.md), except that this function adheres to the Universal Windows Platform app security model.


## -parameters

### -param lpFileName

The name of the file or device to be created or opened. You may use either forward slashes (/) or backslashes (\\) in this name.
    
In the ANSI version of this function, the name is limited to **MAX\_PATH** characters. To extend this limit to 32,767 wide characters, call the Unicode version of the function and prepend "\\\\?\\" to the path. For more information, see [Naming Files, Paths, and Namespaces](/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file).

For information on special device names, see [Defining an MS-DOS Device Name](/windows/win32/fileio/defining-an-ms-dos-device-name).

To create a file stream, specify the name of the file, a colon, and then the name of the stream. For more information, see [File Streams](/windows/win32/fileio/file-streams).

For the unicode version of this function (**CreateFileFromAppW**), you can opt-in to remove the **MAX\_PATH** limitation without prepending "\\\\?\\". See the "Maximum Path Length Limitation" section of [Naming Files, Paths, and Namespaces](/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file) for details.


### -param dwDesiredAccess

The requested access to the file or device, which can be summarized as read, write, both or neither zero).

The most commonly used values are **GENERIC\_READ**, **GENERIC\_WRITE**, or both (`GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE`). For more information, see [Generic Access Rights](/windows/win32/secauthz/generic-access-rights), [File Security and Access Rights](/windows/win32/fileio/file-security-and-access-rights), [**File Access Rights Constants**](/windows/win32/fileio/file-access-rights-constants), and [**ACCESS\_MASK**](/windows/win32/secauthz/access-mask).

If this parameter is zero, the application can query certain metadata such as file, directory, or device attributes without accessing that file or device, even if **GENERIC\_READ** access would have been denied.

You cannot request an access mode that conflicts with the sharing mode that is specified by the *dwShareMode* parameter in an open request that already has an open handle.


### -param dwShareMode

 The requested sharing mode of the file or device, which can be read, write, both, delete, all of these, or none (refer to the following table). Access requests to attributes or extended attributes are not affected by this flag.

### -param lpSecurityAttributes

A pointer to a [**SECURITY\_ATTRIBUTES**](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/aa379560(v=vs.85)) structure that contains two separate but related data members: an optional security descriptor, and a Boolean value that determines whether the returned handle can be inherited by child processes.
    
This parameter can be **NULL**.

If this parameter is **NULL**, the handle returned cannot be inherited by any child processes the application may create and the file or device associated with the returned handle gets a default security descriptor.

The **lpSecurityDescriptor** member of the structure specifies a [**SECURITY\_DESCRIPTOR**](../winnt/ns-winnt-security_descriptor.md) for a file or device. If this member is **NULL**, the file or device associated with the returned handle is assigned a default security descriptor.

This function ignores the **lpSecurityDescriptor** member when opening an existing file or device, but continues to use the **bInheritHandle** member.

The **bInheritHandle** member of the structure specifies whether the returned handle can be inherited.


### -param dwCreationDisposition

 An action to take on a file or device that exists or does not exist.
    
For devices other than files, this parameter is usually set to **OPEN\_EXISTING**.

For more information, see the Remarks section.

This parameter must be one of the following values, which cannot be combined:

### -param dwFlagsAndAttributes

The file or device attributes and flags, **FILE\_ATTRIBUTE\_NORMAL** being the most common default value for files.
    
This parameter can include any combination of the available file attributes (**FILE\_ATTRIBUTE\_\***). All other file attributes override **FILE\_ATTRIBUTE\_NORMAL**.

This parameter can also contain combinations of flags (**FILE\_FLAG\_\***) for control of file or device caching behavior, access modes, and other special-purpose flags. These combine with any **FILE\_ATTRIBUTE\_\*** values.

This parameter can also contain Security Quality of Service (SQOS) information by specifying the **SECURITY\_SQOS\_PRESENT** flag. Additional SQOS-related flags information is presented in the table following the attributes and flags tables.

### -param hTemplateFile

 A valid handle to a template file with the **GENERIC\_READ** access right. The template file supplies file attributes and extended attributes for the file that is being created.
    
This parameter can be **NULL**.

When opening an existing file, this parameter is ignored.

When opening a new encrypted file, the file inherits the discretionary access control list from its parent directory. For more information, see [File Encryption](/windows/win32/fileio/file-encryption).


## -returns

If the function succeeds, the return value is an open handle to the specified file, device, named pipe, or mail slot.

If the function fails, the return value is **INVALID\_HANDLE\_VALUE**. To get extended error information, call [**GetLastError**](../errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror.md).
