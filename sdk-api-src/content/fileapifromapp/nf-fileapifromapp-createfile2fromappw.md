## -description

Creates or opens a file or I/O device. The behavior of this function is identical to [**CreateFile2**](../fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfile2.md), except that this function adheres to the Universal Windows Platform app security model.


## -parameters

### -param lpFileName

The name of the file or device to be created or opened.
    
For information on special device names, see [Defining an MS-DOS Device Name](/windows/win32/fileio/defining-an-ms-dos-device-name).
    
To create a file stream, specify the name of the file, a colon, and then the name of the stream. For more information, see [File Streams](/windows/win32/fileio/file-streams).
    
For information about opting out of the **MAX\_PATH** limitation without prepending "\\\\?\\", see the "Maximum Path Length Limitation" section of [Naming Files, Paths, and Namespaces](/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file) for details.

### -param dwDesiredAccess

The requested access to the file or device, which can be summarized as read, write, both or neither zero).

The most commonly used values are **GENERIC\_READ**, **GENERIC\_WRITE**, or both (`GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE`). For more information, see [Generic Access Rights](/windows/win32/secauthz/generic-access-rights), [File Security and Access Rights](/windows/win32/fileio/file-security-and-access-rights), [**File Access Rights Constants**](/windows/win32/fileio/file-access-rights-constants), and [**ACCESS\_MASK**](/windows/win32/secauthz/access-mask).

If this parameter is zero, the application can query certain metadata such as file, directory, or device attributes without accessing that file or device, even if **GENERIC\_READ** access would have been denied.

You cannot request an access mode that conflicts with the sharing mode that is specified by the *dwShareMode* parameter in an open request that already has an open handle.


### -param dwShareMode

The requested sharing mode of the file or device, which can be read, write, both, delete, all of these, or none (refer to the following table). Access requests to attributes or extended attributes are not affected by this flag.
    
If this parameter is zero and the function succeeds, the file or device cannot be shared and cannot be opened again until the handle to the file or device is closed. For more information, see the Remarks section.

You can't request a sharing mode that conflicts with the access mode that is specified in an existing request that has an open handle. This function would fail and the [**GetLastError**](../errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror.md) function would return **ERROR\_SHARING\_VIOLATION**.

To enable a process to share a file or device while another process has the file or device open, use a compatible combination of one or more of the following values. For more information about valid combinations of this parameter with the *dwDesiredAccess* parameter, see [Creating and Opening Files](/windows/win32/fileio/creating-and-opening-files).

**Note**  The sharing options for each open handle remain in effect until that handle is closed, regardless of process context.

### -param dwCreationDisposition

An action to take on a file or device that exists or does not exist.
    
For devices other than files, this parameter is usually set to **OPEN\_EXISTING**.

### -param pCreateExParams

Pointer to an optional [**CREATEFILE2\_EXTENDED\_PARAMETERS**](../fileapi/ns-fileapi-createfile2_extended_parameters.md) structure.


## -returns

If the function succeeds, the return value is an open handle to the specified file, device, named pipe, or mail slot.

If the function fails, the return value is **INVALID\_HANDLE\_VALUE**. To get extended error information, call [**GetLastError**](../errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror.md).
