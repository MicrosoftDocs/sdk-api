## -description

These APIs are used to query attributes of a host and Isolated Environment. Applications need a reliable mechanism to find out which execution environment they are running in â€“ host or an Isolated Environment. This allows an application to orchestrate its user experience based on the system/user/app resources and app functionality available inside the Isolated Environment.

## -remarks

Since applications behave differently in the host vs the Isolated Environment, they expose a different feature set depending on where they are running. Malicious actors have incentive to mimic the mechanism to get free access to the features only available inside the Isolated Environment. This could have direct monetization impact on the applications to lose revenue generated by app licensing, etc.
