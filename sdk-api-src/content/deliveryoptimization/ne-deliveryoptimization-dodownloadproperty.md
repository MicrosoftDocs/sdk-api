## -description

The **DODownloadProperty** enumeration specifies the ID of properties for the Delivery Optimization download operation. This enumeration is used by the **IDODownload** interface, and carried out by a VARIANT value, where the type of value is contained.

## -enum-fields

### -field DODownloadProperty_Id

Read-only. Use this property to get the ID that uniquely identifies the download. VARIANT type is VT_BSTR.

### -field DODownloadProperty_Uri

Use this property to set or get the remote URI path of the resource to download. This property is required only if *DODownloadProperty_ContentId* isn't provided. VARIANT type is VT_BSTR.

### -field DODownloadProperty_ContentId

Use this property to set or get the download unique content ID. This property is required only if *DODownloadProperty_Uri* isn't provided. VARIANT type is VT_BSTR.

### -field DODownloadProperty_DisplayName

Optional. Use this property to set or get the download display name. VARIANT type is VT_BSTR.

### -field DODownloadProperty_LocalPath

Use this property to set or get the local path name to save the download file. If the path does not exist, Delivery Optimization will attempt to create it under the caller's privileges. This property is required only if *DODownloadProperty_StreamInterface* wasnâ€™t provided. VARIANT type is VT_BSTR.

### -field DODownloadProperty_HttpCustomHeaders

Optional. Use this property to set or get custom HTTP request headers. Delivery Optimization will include these headers during HTTP file request operations. The headers must already be formatted as standard HTTP headers. VARIANT type is VT_BSTR.

### -field DODownloadProperty_CostPolicy

Optional. Use this property to set or get one of the **DODownloadCostPolicy** enumeration values. VARIANT type is VT_UI4.

### -field DODownloadProperty_SecurityFlags

Optional write-only. Use this property to set or get the standard WinHTTP security flags (**WINHTTP_OPTION_SECURITY_FLAGS**). VARIANT type is VT_UI4.

The following flags are supported:

* **SECURITY_FLAG_IGNORE_CERT_CN_INVALID**. Allows an invalid common name in a certificate.
* **SECURITY_FLAG_IGNORE_CERT_DATE_INVALID**. Allows an invalid certificate date.
* **SECURITY_FLAG_IGNORE_UNKNOWN_CA**. Allows an invalid certificate authority.
* **SECURITY_FLAG_IGNORE_CERT_WRONG_USAGE**. Allows the identity of a server to be established with a non-server certificate.
* **WINHTTP_ENABLE_SSL_REVOCATION**. Allows SSL revocation. If this flag is set, the above flags will be ignored.

### -field DODownloadProperty_CallbackFreqPercent

Optional. Use this property to set or get callback frequency based on download percentage. VARIANT type is VT_UI4.

### -field DODownloadProperty_CallbackFreqSeconds

Optional. Use this property to set or get callback frequency based on download time. The default is every one second. VARIANT type is VT_UI4.

### -field DODownloadProperty_NoProgressTimeoutSeconds

Optional. Use this property to set or get the download timeout length for no progress. The minimum accepted value is 60 seconds of no download activity. VARIANT type is VT_UI4.

### -field DODownloadProperty_ForegroundPriority

Optional. Use this property to set or get the current download priority. VARIANT_TRUE value will bring the download to the foreground with higher priority. The default is background priority. VARIANT type is VT_BOOL.

### -field DODownloadProperty_BlockingMode

Optional. Use this property to set or get the current download blocking mode. VARIANT_TRUE value will cause **IDODownload::Start** to block until download is complete or error has occurred. The default is nonblocking mode. VARIANT type is VT_BOOL.

### -field DODownloadProperty_CallbackInterface

Optional. Use this property to set or get the pointer to **IDODownloadStatusCallback** interface used for download callbacks. VARIANT type is VT_UNKNOWN.

### -field DODownloadProperty_StreamInterface

Optional. Use this property to set or get the pointer to IStream interface used for stream download type. VARIANT type is VT_UNKNOWN.

### -field DODownloadProperty_SecurityContext

Optional write-only. Use this property to set the certificate context to be used during HTTP request operations. The value must consist of serialized bytes of CERT_CONTEXT. VARIANT type is (VT_ARRAY \| VT_UI1).

### -field DODownloadProperty_NetworkToken

Optional write-only. Use this property to set the network token to be used during HTTP operations. VARIANT_TRUE value will cause Delivery Optimization to capture the caller's identity token and VARIANT_FALSE will clear the existing token. The default is the token of the logged-on user. VARIANT type is VT_BOOL.

### -field DODownloadProperty_CorrelationVector

Optional. Sets a specific correlation vector for telemetry purposes. VARIANT type is VT_BSTR.

### -field DODownloadProperty_DecryptionInfo

Optional write-only. Sets decryption information in the form of a JSON string. VARIANT type is VT_BSTR.

### -field DODownloadProperty_IntegrityCheckInfo

Optional write-only. Sets the piece hash file (PHF) location, which is used by Delivery Optimization to perform runtime integrity checks on the downloaded content. VARIANT type is VT_BSTR.

### -field DODownloadProperty_IntegrityCheckMandatory

Optional. Sets a Boolean flag indicating whether usage of the piece hash file (PHF) is mandatory. If VARIANT_TRUE, the download will be aborted if the integrity check fails. VARIANT type is VT_BOOL.

### -field DODownloadProperty_TotalSizeBytes

Optional. Specifies the total download size in bytes. VARIANT type is VT_UI8.

### -field DODownloadProperty_DisallowOnCellular

Don't download when on a cellular connection.

### -field DODownloadProperty_HttpCustomAuthHeaders

Custom HTTPS headers are used when challenged.

### -field DODownloadProperty_HttpAllowSecureToNonSecureRedirect

Https-to-http redirection. Default is `FALSE`.

### -field DODownloadProperty_NonVolatile

Save download info to the Windows Registry. Default is `FALSE` for Delivery Optimization download jobs; `TRUE` for BITS-style jobs.
