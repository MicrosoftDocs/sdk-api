# ITsSbClientConnection interface


## -description

Exposes methods and properties that store state information about an incoming connection request from a 
    Remote Desktop  Connection (RDC) client. This information does not need to be stored on the resource or 
    filter plug-ins, which allows the plug-ins to be stateless.

Plug-ins can use this interface to obtain information about a connection request initiated by a client, and then 
    make decisions about load balancing, placement, and orchestration. This interface also stores the results of all 
    these operations. A <b>ITsSbClientConnection</b> object 
    should persist until the client successfully logs on to a target computer.

## -inheritance

The <b>ITsSbClientConnection</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>ITsSbClientConnection</b> also has these types of members:
