# ldap_delete_ext_sA function


## -description

The <b>ldap_delete_ext_s</b> function is an extended routine that performs a synchronous operation to remove a leaf entry from the directory tree.

## -parameters

### -param ld [in]

The session handle.

### -param dn [in]

A pointer to a null-terminated string that contains the distinguished name of the entry to delete.

### -param ServerControls [in]

Optional. List of LDAP server controls. Set this parameter to <b>NULL</b> if not used.

### -param ClientControls [in]

Optional. List of client controls. Set this parameter to <b>NULL</b> if not used.

## -returns

If the function succeeds, <b>LDAP_SUCCESS</b> is returned.

If the function fails, an error code is returned. For more information, see 
<a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ldap/return-values">Return Values</a>.

## -remarks

Call <b>ldap_delete_ext_s</b> to remove a leaf entry from the directory tree. LDAP does not support deletion of entire subtrees in a single operation, however there is an extended control, <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ldap/ldap-server-tree-delete-oid">LDAP_SERVER_TREE_DELETE_OID</a>, that does provide this. The parameters and effects of <b>ldap_delete_ext_s</b> include those of 
<a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/winldap/nf-winldap-ldap_delete_s">ldap_delete_s</a>. The extended routine includes additional parameters to support client and server controls and thread safety.

As a synchronous function, <b>ldap_delete_ext_s</b> returns when the delete operation is complete. Use 
<a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/winldap/nf-winldap-ldap_delete">ldap_delete</a> or 
<a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/winldap/nf-winldap-ldap_delete_ext">ldap_delete_ext</a> to have the delete operation performed asynchronously.

Multithreading: Calls to <b>ldap_delete_ext_s</b> are thread-safe.
