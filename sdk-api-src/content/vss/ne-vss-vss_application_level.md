# VSS_APPLICATION_LEVEL enumeration


## -description


The <b>VSS_APPLICATION_LEVEL</b> enumeration indicates 
    the application level, the point in the course of the creation of a shadow copy that a writer is notified of a 
    freeze.

VSS first sends a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VSS/vssgloss-f">Freeze</a> event to writers 
    initialized with <b>VSS_APP_FRONT_END</b> (called front-end level applications), then to 
    writers initialized with <b>VSS_APP_BACK_END</b> (called back-end level applications), and 
    finally to writers initialized with <b>VSS_APP_SYSTEM</b> (called system-level 
    applications).


## -enum-fields




### -field VSS_APP_UNKNOWN

The level at which this writer's freeze state will occur is not known. This indicates an application 
      error.


### -field VSS_APP_SYSTEM

This writer freeze state will occur at the system application level.


### -field VSS_APP_BACK_END

This writer freeze state will occur at the back-end application level.


### -field VSS_APP_FRONT_END

This writer freeze state will occur at the front-end application level.


### -field VSS_APP_SYSTEM_RM


### -field VSS_APP_AUTO

This writer freeze state will be determined automatically. This enumeration value is reserved for future 
      use.


## -remarks



<b>VSS_APPLICATION_LEVEL</b> is provided to allow 
    application developers to control at what point a writer will receive a Freeze event. This may be important if one 
    writer uses or depends on another writer.

For instance, if an application <i>X</i> is storing data using application 
    <i>Y</i> as an intermediate layer (for example, if <i>Y</i> implements a 
    database used by <i>X</i>), we would describe <i>X</i> as a front-end 
    application, and <i>Y</i> as a back-end application.

In this example, when freezing applications that participate in a shadow copy, you would want 
    <i>X</i> (the front-end application) to suspend its writes to the database prior to freezing 
    <i>Y </i>(the back-end application), the database service itself.

The application level of a writer is set by 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-initialize">CVssWriter::Initialize</a> and retrieved by 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-getcurrentlevel">CVssWriter::GetCurrentLevel</a>.
