## -remarks



The shadow copy state is contained in the <b>m_eStatus</b> member of a 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vss/ns-vss-vss_snapshot_prop">VSS_SNAPSHOT_PROP</a> object, which can be obtained for a 
    single shadow copy by calling 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vsbackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-getsnapshotproperties">IVssBackupComponents::GetSnapshotProperties</a>.

Because 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vsbackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-getsnapshotproperties">IVssBackupComponents::GetSnapshotProperties</a> 
    fails during shadow copy creation with <b>VSS_E_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND</b>, a requester cannot obtain 
    any <b>VSS_SNAPSHOT_STATE</b> value other than 
    <b>VSS_SS_CREATED</b>.

Calls to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vsbackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-query">IVssBackupComponents::Query</a> can 
    also be used to obtain the shadow copy state. 
    <b>IVssBackupComponents::Query</b> is used to return 
    lists of shadow copies, which may be iterated over by means of the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vss/nn-vss-ivssenumobject">IVssEnumObject</a> interface to obtain 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vss/ns-vss-vss_snapshot_prop">VSS_SNAPSHOT_PROP</a> objects for each shadow copy that 
    have completed on a given system. This means that, like 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vsbackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-getsnapshotproperties">IVssBackupComponents::GetSnapshotProperties</a>, 
    the <b>IVssBackupComponents::Query</b> method can 
    return only a shadow copy state of <b>VSS_SS_CREATED</b>.
