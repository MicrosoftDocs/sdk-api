# IXMLHTTPRequest2Callback::OnResponseReceived


## -description


Occurs when a client has received a complete response from the server.


## -parameters




### -param pXHR [in, optional]

The initial HTTP request object


### -param pResponseStream [in, optional]

The response stream being received. The client can call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-isequentialstream-read">ISequentialStream::Read</a> to begin processing the data, or it can store a reference to <i>pResponseStream</i> for later processing. This response stream is wrapped in a stream synchronization object that prevents concurrent read and write operations, so the application does not need to implement custom synchronization.


## -returns



Returns <b>S_OK</b> on success.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This callback function must not throw exceptions.</div>
<div> </div>



## -remarks



When this event fires the application can begin processing data from the HTTP response. Processing may begin before this event fires if an earlier <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/msxml6/nf-msxml6-ixmlhttprequest2callback-ondataavailable">OnDataAvailable</a> event has occurred.

Unless <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/msxml6/nf-msxml6-ixmlhttprequest2callback-onerror">OnError</a> is called, the call to <b>OnResponseReceived</b> is the final callback. The client should perform any required cleanup including releasing references to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/msxml6/nn-msxml6-ixmlhttprequest2">IXMLHTTPRequest2</a> object.

Custom streams receive a call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-isequentialstream-write">ISequentialStream::Write</a> specifying 0 bytes written before <b>OnResponseReceived</b> is fired. The client can process data directly from the Write call instead of calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-isequentialstream-read">ISequentialStream::Read</a> on the custom stream, and it can rely on the zero-byte Write call to indicate that the response has been received.
