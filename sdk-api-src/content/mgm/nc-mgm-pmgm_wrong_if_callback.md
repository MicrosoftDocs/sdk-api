# PMGM_WRONG_IF_CALLBACK callback function


## -description


The 
<b>PMGM_WRONG_IF_CALLBACK</b> is a call into a routing protocol to notify the protocol that a packet has been received from the specified source and for the specified group on the wrong interface.


## -parameters




### -param dwSourceAddr [in]

Specifies the source address from which the multicast data was received. Zero indicates that data is received from all sources (a wildcard receiver for a group); otherwise, the value of <i>dwSourceAddr</i> is the IP address of the source or source network.


### -param dwGroupAddr [in]

Specifies the multicast group for which the data is destined. Zero indicates that all groups are received (a wildcard receiver); otherwise, the value of <i>dwGroupAddr</i> is the IP address of the group.


### -param dwIfIndex [in]

Specifies the interface on which the packet arrived.


### -param dwIfNextHopAddr [in]

Specifies the address of the next hop that corresponds to the index specified by <i>dwIfIndex</i>. The <i>dwIfIndex</i> and <i>dwIfNextHopIPAddr</i> parameters uniquely identify a next hop on point-to-multipoint interfaces. A point-to-multipoint interface is a connection where one interface connects to multiple networks. Examples of point-to-multipoint interfaces include non-broadcast multiple access (NBMA) interfaces and the internal interface on which all dial-up clients connect. 




For broadcast interfaces (such as Ethernet interfaces) or point-to-point interfaces, which are identified by only the value of <i>dwIfIndex</i>, specify zero.


### -param dwHdrSize [in]

Specifies, in bytes, the size of the buffer pointed to by <i>pbPacketHdr</i>.


### -param pbPacketHdr [in]

Pointer to a buffer that contains the IP header of the packet, including the IP options and a fragment of the data. This parameter is used by those protocols that examine the contents of the packet header.


## -returns



RRAS does not expect the application to return any specific value; any value returned is ignored by RRAS.




## -remarks



This callback is not currently available.
