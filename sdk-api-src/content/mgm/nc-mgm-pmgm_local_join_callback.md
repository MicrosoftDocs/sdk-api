# PMGM_LOCAL_JOIN_CALLBACK callback function


## -description

The 
<b>PMGM_LOCAL_JOIN_CALLBACK</b> callback is a call into a routing protocol to notify the protocol that IGMP has detected new receivers for a group on an interface that is currently owned by the routing protocol.

This callback is invoked when the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/mgm/nf-mgm-mgmaddgroupmembershipentry">MgmAddGroupMembershipEntry</a> function is called by IGMP.

## -parameters

### -param dwSourceAddr [in]

Specifies the source address from which the multicast data was received. Zero indicates that data is received from all sources (a wildcard receiver for a group); otherwise, the value of <i>dwSourceAddr</i> is the IP address of the source or source network. 




To specify a range of source addresses, the multicast group manager specifies the source network using <i>dwSourceAddr</i>, and specifies a subnet mask using <i>dwSourceMask</i>.

### -param dwSourceMask [in]

Specifies the subnet mask that corresponds to <i>dwSourceAddr</i>. The <i>dwSourceAddr</i> and <i>dwSourceMask</i> parameters are used together to define a range of sources from which to receive multicast data. 




The multicast group manager specifies zero for this parameter if it also specified zero for <i>dwSourceAddr</i> (a wildcard receiver).

### -param dwGroupAddr [in]

Specifies the multicast group for which the data is destined. Zero indicates that all groups are received (a wildcard receiver); otherwise the value of <i>dwGroupAddr</i> is the IP address of the group. 




To specify a range of group addresses, the multicast group manager specifies the group address using <i>dwGroupAddr</i>, and specifies a subnet mask using <i>dwGroupMask</i>.

### -param dwGroupMask [in]

Specifies the subnet mask that corresponds to <i>dwGroupAddr</i>. The <i>dwGroupAddr</i> and <i>dwGroupMask</i> parameters are used together to define a range of multicast groups. 




The multicast group manager specifies zero for this parameter if it also specified zero for <i>dwGroupAddr</i> (a wildcard receiver).

### -param dwIfIndex [in]

Specifies the interface on which the multicast data from the source should arrive.

### -param dwIfNextHopAddr [in]

Specifies the address of the next hop that corresponds to the index specified by <i>dwIfIndex</i>. The <i>dwIfIndex</i> and <i>dwIfNextHopIPAddr</i> parameters uniquely identify a next hop on point-to-multipoint interfaces. A point-to-multipoint interface is a connection where one interface connects to multiple networks. Examples of point-to-multipoint interfaces include non-broadcast multiple access (NBMA) interfaces and the internal interface on which all dial-up clients connect. 




For broadcast interfaces (such as Ethernet interfaces) or point-to-point interfaces, which are identified by only the value of <i>dwIfIndex</i>, specify zero.

## -returns

RRAS does not expect the application to return any specific value; any value returned is ignored by RRAS.

## -remarks

This version of the Multicast Group Manager API supports only wildcard sources (*, g) or specific sources (s, g), not a range of sources. The same restriction applies to groups (that is, no group ranges are permitted).
