### -field dwCallbackFlags

Reserved for future use.


### -field pfnRpfCallback

Callback into a routing protocol to perform an RPF check.


### -field pfnCreationAlertCallback

Callback into a routing protocol to determine the subset of interfaces owned by the routing protocol on which a multicast packet from a new source or to a new group should be forwarded.


### -field pfnPruneAlertCallback

Callback into a routing protocol to notify the protocol that receivers for the specified source and group are no longer present on an interface owned by other routing protocols.


### -field pfnJoinAlertCallback

Callback into a routing protocol to notify the protocol that new receivers for the specified source and group are present on an interface owned by another routing protocol.


### -field pfnWrongIfCallback

Callback into a routing protocol to notify the protocol that a packet has been received from the specified source and for the specified group on the wrong interface.


### -field pfnLocalJoinCallback

Callback into a routing protocol to notify the protocol that IGMP has detected new receivers for a group on an interface.


### -field pfnLocalLeaveCallback

Callback into a routing protocol to notify the protocol that IGMP has detected that there are no more receivers for a group on an interface.


### -field pfnDisableIgmpCallback

Callback into IGMP to notify IGMP that a protocol is taking or releasing ownership of an interface on which IGMP is enabled.


### -field pfnEnableIgmpCallback

Callback into IGMP to notify IGMP that a protocol has finished taking or releasing ownership of an interface on which IGMP is enabled.
