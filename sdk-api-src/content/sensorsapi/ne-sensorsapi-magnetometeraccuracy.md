# MagnetometerAccuracy enumeration


## -description

Specifies the accuracy of the magnetometer.

## -enum-fields

### -field MAGNETOMETER_ACCURACY_UNKNOWN:0

### -field MAGNETOMETER_ACCURACY_UNRELIABLE

### -field MAGNETOMETER_ACCURACY_APPROXIMATE

### -field MAGNETOMETER_ACCURACY_HIGH

#### - Approximate

The actual and reported values differ but may be accurate enough for some application. Apps that only need a relative value, like a virtual reality app, can continue without additional calibration. 


#### - High

The actual and reported values are accurate. No additional calibration is needed. 


#### - Unknown

This value is not used. 


#### - Unreliable

The reported values have a high degree of inaccuracy. Apps will typically ask the user to calibrate the device whenever this value is returned.

## -remarks

Apps that need calibration may periodically ask the user to calibrate the device. We suggest doing this no more than once every 10 minutes.
