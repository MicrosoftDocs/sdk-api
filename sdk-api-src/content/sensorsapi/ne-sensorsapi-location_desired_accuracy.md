# LOCATION_DESIRED_ACCURACY enumeration


## -description

The <b>LOCATION_DESIRED_ACCURACY </b>enumeration type defines values for the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/sensors/sensor-properties2">SENSOR_PROPERTY_LOCATION_DESIRED_ACCURACY</a> property.

## -enum-fields

### -field LOCATION_DESIRED_ACCURACY_DEFAULT

Indicates that the sensor should use the accuracy for which it can optimize power and other such cost considerations.

### -field LOCATION_DESIRED_ACCURACY_HIGH

Indicates that the sensor should deliver the highest-accuracy report possible. This includes using services that might charge money, or consuming higher levels of battery power or connection bandwidth.
