# IDirectInputEffectDriver::AddRef


## -description


The <b>IDirectInputEffectDriver::AddRef </b>method increases the reference count of the DirectInputEffectDriver object by 1. This method is part of the <b>IUnknown</b> interface inherited by DirectInputEffectDriver. 


## -parameters






## -returns



Returns S_OK if successful; otherwise, returns an error code.




## -remarks



When the DirectInputEffectDriver object is created, its reference count should be set to 1. Each time an application obtains an interface to the object or calls the <b>AddRef</b> method, the object's reference count is increased by 1. The application uses the <b>Release</b> method to decrease the reference count of the object by 1.
