# SOCKET_PROCESSOR_AFFINITY structure


## -description

The <b>SOCKET_PROCESSOR_AFFINITY</b> structure contains the association between a socket and an RSS processor core and NUMA node..

## -struct-fields

### -field Processor

A structure to represent a system wide processor number. This <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winnt/ns-winnt-processor_number">PROCESSOR_NUMBER</a> structure contains a
group number and relative processor number within the group.

### -field NumaNodeId

The NUMA node ID.

### -field Reserved

A value reserved for future use.

## -remarks

The <b>SOCKET_PROCESSOR_AFFINITY</b>  structure is supported on Windows 8,   and Windows Server 2012, and later versions of the operating system.

The <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/jj553482(v=vs.85)">SIO_QUERY_RSS_PROCESSOR_INFO</a> 
        IOCTL is used to determine the association between a socket and an RSS processor core and NUMA node. This IOCTL returns a <b>SOCKET_PROCESSOR_AFFINITY</b> structure that contains the processor number and the NUMA node ID.
