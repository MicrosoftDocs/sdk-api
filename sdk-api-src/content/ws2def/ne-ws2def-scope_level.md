# SCOPE_LEVEL enumeration


## -description

The <b>SCOPE_LEVEL</b> enumeration is used with the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/iptypes/ns-iptypes-ip_adapter_addresses_lh">IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES</a> structure to identify scope levels for IPv6 addresses.

## -enum-fields

### -field ScopeLevelInterface:1

The scope is interface-level.

### -field ScopeLevelLink:2

The scope is link-level.

### -field ScopeLevelSubnet:3

The scope is subnet-level.

### -field ScopeLevelAdmin:4

The scope is admin-level.

### -field ScopeLevelSite:5

The scope is site-level.

### -field ScopeLevelOrganization:8

The scope is organization-level.

### -field ScopeLevelGlobal:14

The scope is global.

### -field ScopeLevelCount:16

## -remarks

The <b>SCOPE_LEVEL</b> enumeration is used in the <b>ZoneIndices</b> member of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/iptypes/ns-iptypes-ip_adapter_addresses_lh">IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES</a>  structure.

On Windows Vista and later as well as on the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK), the organization of header files has changed and the <b>SCOPE_LEVEL</b> enumeration type is defined in the <i>Ws2def.h</i> header file. Note that the <i>Ws2def.h</i> header file is automatically included in <i>Winsock2.h</i>, and should never be used directly.
