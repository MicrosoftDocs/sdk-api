# IWSDiscoveryProviderNotify::SearchFailed


## -description


Is called to indicate a user initiated search has failed.


## -parameters




### -param hr [in]

Cause of the search failure which initiated this callback.  A value of <b>S_FALSE</b> indicates the search completed without issuing any Add callbacks.


### -param pszTag [in, optional]

Optional identifier tag for this search.  May be <b>NULL</b>.


## -returns



The return value is not meaningful.  An implementer should return <b>S_OK</b>.




## -remarks




<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wsddisco/nf-wsddisco-iwsdiscoveryprovidernotify-searchcomplete">SearchComplete</a> is called if any responses were succesfully received.

<b>SearchFailed</b> is called if a user initiated query does not result in a response. In this case, the value of the <i>hr</i> parameter will be S_FALSE.  <b>SearchFailed</b> can optionally be called if errors occur in the attempted transmission of the query, since query transmission is not necessarily synchronous. <i>pszTag</i> will match the user supplied tag from the query, and should be used to identify which query failed. 

The interval between initiating the search with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wsddisco/nf-wsddisco-iwsdiscoveryprovider-searchbytype">SearchByType</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wsddisco/nf-wsddisco-iwsdiscoveryprovider-searchbyid">SearchById</a>  and receiving a <b>SearchFailed</b> notification is a maximum of 10 seconds, based on MATCH_TIMEOUT from <a href="https://specs.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/04/discovery/ws-discovery.pdf">WS-Discovery</a> and amended by the <a href="https://specs.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/devprof/devicesprofile.pdf">DPWS Appendix I</a>. The interval between initiating the search with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wsddisco/nf-wsddisco-iwsdiscoveryprovider-searchbyaddress">SearchByAddress</a> and receipt of a <b>SearchFailed</b> notification is typically 21 seconds, but can be a maximum of 150 seconds.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Multiple simultaneous calls may be made to <b>SearchFailed</b> by the provider, so it is essential that shared data be synchronized in this callback.</div>
