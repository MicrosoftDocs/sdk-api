## -remarks



This method can be called only once on a provider. This method must be called before a notification sink is attached to the provider. That means <b>SetAddressFamily</b> must be called before <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wsddisco/nf-wsddisco-iwsdiscoveryprovider-attach">Attach</a> is called on a provider.
