# DIEFFESCAPE structure


## -description


The <b>DIEFFESCAPE</b> structure passes hardware-specific data directly to the device driver. 


## -struct-fields




### -field dwSize

Specifies the size of the structure in bytes. This member must be initialized before the structure is used. 


### -field dwCommand

Specifies a driver-specific command number. Contact the hardware vendor for a list of valid commands and their parameters. 


### -field lpvInBuffer

Points to the buffer containing the data required to perform the operation. 


### -field cbInBuffer

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the <b>lpvInBuffer</b> buffer. 


### -field lpvOutBuffer

Points to the buffer in which the operation's output data is returned. 


### -field cbOutBuffer

On entry, specifies the size, in bytes, of the <b>lpvOutBuffer</b> buffer. On exit, specifies the number of bytes actually produced by the command.
