# IFaxSecurity::get_InformationType


## -description


The <b>IFaxSecurity::InformationType</b> property represents the security information type.

This property is read/write.


## -parameters


## -remarks



The information type is a bitwise combination that indicates what security information will be retrieved from the server when requesting a security descriptor using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/faxcomex/nf-faxcomex-ifaxsecurity-get_descriptor">IFaxSecurity::Descriptor</a> property or when refreshing the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/faxcomex/nn-faxcomex-ifaxsecurity">IFaxSecurity</a> object using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fax/-mfax-faxsecurity-refresh-vb">IFaxSecurity::Refresh</a> method. The information type also determines what information is sent to the fax server when you save changes to the <b>IFaxSecurity</b> object using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fax/-mfax-faxsecurity-save-vb">IFaxSecurity::Save</a> method.

The bits are specified in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecAuthZ/security-information">SECURITY_INFORMATION</a> structure, defined in Winnt.h. Each item of security information is designated by a bit flag. The following values specify the bits applicable to the fax service.

<table class="clsStd">
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION</td>
<td>Indicates that the discretionary access control list (ACL) of the object is being referenced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>GROUP_SECURITY_INFORMATION</td>
<td>Indicates that the primary group identifier of the object is being referenced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OWNER_SECURITY_INFORMATION</td>
<td>Indicates that the owner identifier of the object is being referenced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION</td>
<td>Indicates that the system ACL of the object is being referenced.</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

You should set the <b>IFaxSecurity::InformationType</b> property before you call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/faxcomex/nf-faxcomex-ifaxsecurity-get_descriptor">IFaxSecurity::get_Descriptor</a> method to ensure that you receive the information that you want and to ensure that you request only the information for which you have the appropriate access rights. Also, the <b>IFaxSecurity::InformationType</b> property will affect what information is sent to the fax server when you call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fax/-mfax-faxsecurity-save-vb">IFaxSecurity::Save</a> method. If you do not set the <b>IFaxSecurity::InformationType</b> property, it defaults to the flags DACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION, GROUP_SECURITY_INFORMATION, and OWNER_SECURITY_INFORMATION.
