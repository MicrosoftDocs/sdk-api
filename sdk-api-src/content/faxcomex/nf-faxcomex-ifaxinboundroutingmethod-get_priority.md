# IFaxInboundRoutingMethod::get_Priority


## -description


The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fax/-mfax-faxinboundroutingmethod-priority">Priority</a> property is a value associated with the order in which the fax service calls the routing method when the service receives a fax job.

This property is read/write.


## -parameters


## -remarks



Valid values for this property are 1 through <i>n</i>, where 1 is the highest priority.

You should assign a unique priority value to each routing method. After you call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fax/-mfax-faxinboundroutingmethod-save-vb">IFaxInboundRoutingMethod::Save</a> method, the fax service sorts the routing methods by priority. If two routing methods have the same priority, the fax service will choose which will have a higher priority.

If you want a particular routing method to have the lowest possible priority, specify a very large value, such as 999999, and then call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fax/-mfax-faxinboundroutingmethod-save-vb">IFaxInboundRoutingMethod::Save</a> method.

To read or to write to this property, a user must have the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/faxcomex/ne-faxcomex-fax_access_rights_enum">farQUERY_CONFIG</a> access right.
