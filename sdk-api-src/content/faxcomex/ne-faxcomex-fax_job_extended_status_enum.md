# FAX_JOB_EXTENDED_STATUS_ENUM enumeration


## -description


The <b>FAX_JOB_EXTENDED_STATUS_ENUM</b> enumeration defines the extended status values for a fax job. These are basic values provided for developers of a fax service provider (FSP). However, with the exception of <b><b>fjesPARTIALLY_RECEIVED</b></b>, these values or other proprietary values that may be developed for a specific FSP, are not recognized or interpreted by the fax server.


## -enum-fields




### -field fjesNONE

No extended status value.


### -field fjesDISCONNECTED

The sender or the caller disconnected the fax call.


### -field fjesINITIALIZING

The device is initializing a call.


### -field fjesDIALING

The device is dialing a fax number.


### -field fjesTRANSMITTING

The device is sending a fax.


### -field fjesANSWERED

The device answered a new call.


### -field fjesRECEIVING

The device is receiving a fax.


### -field fjesLINE_UNAVAILABLE

The device is not available because it is in use by another application.


### -field fjesBUSY

The device encountered a busy signal.


### -field fjesNO_ANSWER

The receiving device did not answer the call.


### -field fjesBAD_ADDRESS

The device dialed an invalid fax number.


### -field fjesNO_DIAL_TONE

The sending device cannot complete the call because it does not detect a dial tone.


### -field fjesFATAL_ERROR

The device has encountered a fatal protocol error.


### -field fjesCALL_DELAYED

The device delayed a fax call because the sending device received a busy signal multiple times. The device cannot retry the call because dialing restrictions exist. (Some countries/regions restrict the number of retry attempts when a number is busy.)


### -field fjesCALL_BLACKLISTED

The device could not complete a call because the telephone number was blocked or reserved; emergency numbers such as 911 are blocked. 


### -field fjesNOT_FAX_CALL

The device received a call that was a data call or a voice call.


### -field fjesPARTIALLY_RECEIVED

The incoming fax was partially received. Some (but not all) of the pages are available.


### -field fjesHANDLED

The fax service processed the outbound fax; the fax service provider will transmit the fax.


### -field fjesCALL_COMPLETED

The call was completed.


### -field fjesCALL_ABORTED

The call was aborted.


### -field fjesPROPRIETARY

Obsolete. For information about proprietary extended status codes, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fax/-mfax-faxoutgoingjob-extendedstatuscode-vb">IFaxOutgoingJob::get_ExtendedStatusCode</a>.
