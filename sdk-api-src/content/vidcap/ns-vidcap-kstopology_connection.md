# KSTOPOLOGY_CONNECTION structure


## -description



This topic applies to Windows XP Service Pack 2 or later.
          

The <b>KSTOPOLOGY_CONNECTION</b> structure describes a node connection within a kernel-streaming (KS) filter. A node can be connected to another node within the filter, or to a pin on the filter.




## -struct-fields




### -field FromNode

Index of the upstream node in the connection. If the upstream connection is a pin, rather than a node, the value is KSFILTER_NODE.


### -field FromNodePin

If the value of the <b>FromNode</b> field is KSFILTER_NODE, this field specifies the index of the upstream pin. Otherwise, this field is ignored.


### -field ToNode

Index of the downstream node in the connection. If the downstream connection is a pin, rather than a node, the value is KSFILTER_NODE.


### -field ToNodePin

If the value of the <b>ToNode</b> field is KSFILTER_NODE, this field specifies the index of the downstream pin. Otherwise, this field is ignored.
