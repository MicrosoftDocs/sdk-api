# ICameraControl interface


## -description

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The <code>ICameraControl</code> interface controls the camera settings on a capture device.

This interface may be exposed by one or more nodes in a capture filter. It is not exposed at the level of the filter itself. To enumerate the nodes, query the filter for the <a href="/windows/win32/api/vidcap/nn-vidcap-ikstopologyinfo">IKsTopologyInfo</a> interface. For each node, call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vidcap/nf-vidcap-ikstopologyinfo-get_nodetype">IKsTopologyInfo::get_NodeType</a> to get the node type. The <code>ICameraControl</code> interface is exposed by nodes of type KSNODETYPE_VIDEO_CAMERA_TERMINAL. Get the interface pointer by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vidcap/nf-vidcap-ikstopologyinfo-createnodeinstance">IKsTopologyInfo::CreateNodeInstance</a> with the value IID_ICameraControl.

This interface corresponds to the PROPSETID_VIDCAP_CAMERACONTROL property set, which is documented in the Windows DDK.

## -inheritance

The <b>ICameraControl</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>ICameraControl</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
