# ITextInputPanel interface


## -description

**ITextInputPanel** is available for use in the operating systems specified in the Requirements section. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, use [IInputPanelConfiguration interface](../inputpanelconfiguration/nn-inputpanelconfiguration-iinputpanelconfiguration.md).

Provides control of appearance and behavior of the Tablet PC Input Panel.

## -inheritance

The <b>ITextInputPanel</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>ITextInputPanel</b> also has these types of members:

## -remarks

<b>ITextInputPanel Interface</b> gives application developers more control and information about Input Panel's state than <a href="/windows/desktop/tablet/peninputpanel-class">PenInputPanel Class</a>. <b>ITextInputPanel Interface</b> replaces the <b>PenInputPanel Class</b> as the preferred mechanism for programmatically interacting with the Input Panel.

<b>ITextInputPanel Interface</b> provides:

<ul>
<li>A complete control over the positioning of the in-place Input Panel when the application has focus.</li>
<li>An access to the ink objects from the Input Panel text insertion in addition to the recognized text.</li>
<li>A set of properties that correspond exactly to Input Panel's capabilities giving both the ability to know Input Panel's current state and to customize Input Panel's configuration.</li>
</ul>
The <b>ITextInputPanel Interface</b> continues to provide nearly all of the programmatic capabilities of the <a href="/windows/desktop/tablet/peninputpanel-class">PenInputPanel Class</a> thus superseding the <b>PenInputPanel Class</b>.

This element is declared in Peninputpanel.h.
