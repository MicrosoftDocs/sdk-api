# IWSDInboundAttachment::Close


## -description


Closes the current attachment MIME data stream.


## -parameters






## -returns



This method can return one of these values.


Possible return values include, but are not limited to, the following.



<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



This method can be used to terminate the transfer of an incoming attachment while the transfer is in progress. 

Usually, <b>Close</b> must be called before calling <b>Release()</b> on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wsdattachment/nn-wsdattachment-iwsdinboundattachment">IWSDInboundAttachment</a>  interface. The only time a <b>Close</b> call is not required is when <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wsdattachment/nf-wsdattachment-iwsdinboundattachment-read">Read</a> returns S_FALSE, which indicates that the end of the attachment stream has been reached. In that case, simply call  <b>Release()</b> on the <b>IWSDInboundAttachment</b>  interface.
