# IDedupBackupSupport interface


## -description

Provides a method for restoring a file from a backup store containing copies of Data Deduplication 
     reparse points, metadata, and container files.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IDedupBackupSupport</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IDedupBackupSupport</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

 A backup application uses the 
     <b>IDedupBackupSupport</b> interface to drive the restore 
     process for a select file from a backup store that contains the fully optimized version of the file (reparse 
     point) and the Data Deduplication store.

This interface is not useful when the backup store contains a copy of the original, non-optimized file.

Applications that use the <b>IDedupBackupSupport</b> 
     interface must also implement the 
     <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/ddpbackup/nn-ddpbackup-idedupreadfilecallback">IDedupReadFileCallback</a> interface.
