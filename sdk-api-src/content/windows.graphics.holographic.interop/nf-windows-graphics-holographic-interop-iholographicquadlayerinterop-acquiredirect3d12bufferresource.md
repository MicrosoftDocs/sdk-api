## -description

The **AcquireDirect3D12BufferResource** method transitions ownership of a Direct3D 12 content buffer resource from the platform to your application. If your application already owns control of the resource, then the acquisition is still considered to be a success.

After committing a resource to a [HolographicFrame](/uwp/api/windows.graphics.holographic.holographicframe) by calling [IHolographicQuadLayerUpdateParametersInterop::CommitDirect3D12Resource](./nf-windows-graphics-holographic-interop-iholographicquadlayerupdateparametersinterop-commitdirect3d12resource.md), your application should consider control of that resource to be relinquished to the system until such a time as it is reacquired by your application using **AcquireDirect3D12BufferResource**. The system owns the buffer until it is no longer needed for presenting the quad layer. To determine whether the system has relinquished control of the buffer, call **AcquireDirect3D12BufferResource** or **AcquireDirect3D12BufferResourceWithTimeout**. If the buffer can't be acquired by the time your application is ready to start rendering a new update for the quad layer, then you should create a new resource and add it to the buffer queue, or limit the queue size by waiting for a buffer to become available.

If the buffer is not ready to be acquired when this method is called, the method call fails and immediately returns the error code **E_NOTREADY**.

Your application can limit the queue size by calling [AcquireDirect3D12BufferResourceWithTimeout](./nf-windows-graphics-holographic-interop-iholographicquadlayerinterop-acquiredirect3d12bufferresourcewithtimeout.md) to wait until a resource becomes available before queuing more work.

## -parameters

### -param pResourceToAcquire

Type: **[ID3D12Resource](../d3d12/nn-d3d12-id3d12resource.md)\***

The Direct3D 12 resource to acquire. The resource will be in the **D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_COMMON** state when it is acquired.

### -param pCommandQueue

Type: **[ID3D12CommandQueue](../d3d12/nn-d3d12-id3d12commandqueue.md)\***

The Direct3D 12 command queue to use for transitioning the state of this resource when acquiring it for your application.

## -returns

**S_OK** if successful, otherwise returns an [HRESULT](/windows/win32/com/structure-of-com-error-codes) error code indicating the reason for failure. Also see [COM Error Codes (UI, Audio, DirectX, Codec)](/windows/win32/com/com-error-codes-10).
