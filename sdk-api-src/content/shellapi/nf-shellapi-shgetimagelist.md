# SHGetImageList function


## -description

Retrieves an image list.

## -parameters

### -param iImageList [in]

Type: <b>int</b>

The image type contained in the list. One of the following values:



#### SHIL_LARGE (0x0)

0x0. The image size is normally 32x32 pixels. However, if the <b>Use large icons</b> option is selected from the <b>Effects</b> section of the <b>Appearance</b> tab in <b>Display Properties</b>, the image is 48x48 pixels.



#### SHIL_SMALL (0x1)

0x1. These images are the Shell standard small icon size of 16x16, but the size can be customized by the user.



#### SHIL_EXTRALARGE (0x2)

0x2. These images are the Shell standard extra-large icon size. This is typically 48x48, but the size can be customized by the user.



#### SHIL_SYSSMALL (0x3)

0x3. These images are the size specified by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getsystemmetrics">GetSystemMetrics</a> called with <b>SM_CXSMICON</b> and <b>GetSystemMetrics</b> called with <b>SM_CYSMICON</b>.



#### SHIL_JUMBO (0x4)

0x4. <b>Windows Vista and later.</b> The image is normally 256x256 pixels.



#### SHIL_LAST

The largest valid flag value, for validation purposes.

### -param riid [in]

Type: <b>REFIID</b>

Reference to the image list interface identifier, normally IID_IImageList.

### -param ppvObj [out]

Type: <b>void**</b>

When this method returns, contains the interface pointer requested in <i>riid</i>. This is typically <a href="/windows/desktop/api/commoncontrols/nn-commoncontrols-iimagelist">IImageList</a>.

## -returns

Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this function succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.

## -remarks

The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/commoncontrols/nn-commoncontrols-iimagelist">IImageList</a> pointer type, such as that returned in the <i>ppv</i> parameter, can be cast as an <b>HIMAGELIST</b> as needed; for example, for use in a list view. Conversely, an <b>HIMAGELIST</b> can be cast as a pointer to an <b>IImageList</b>.

As of Windows Vista, <b>SHIL_SMALL</b>, <b>SHIL_LARGE</b>, and <b>SHIL_EXTRALARGE</b> scale with dots per inch (dpi) if the process is marked as dpi-aware. To set these types to be dpi-aware, call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setprocessdpiaware">SetProcessDPIAware</a>. <b>SHIL_JUMBO</b> is fixed at 256 pixels regardless of the dpi-aware setting.
