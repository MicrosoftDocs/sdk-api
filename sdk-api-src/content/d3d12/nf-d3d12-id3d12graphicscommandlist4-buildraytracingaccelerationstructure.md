# ID3D12GraphicsCommandList4::BuildRaytracingAccelerationStructure


## -description

Performs a raytracing acceleration structure build on the GPU and optionally outputs post-build information immediately after the build.

## -parameters

### -param pDesc [in]

Description of the acceleration structure to build.

### -param NumPostbuildInfoDescs [in]

Size of the <i>pPostbuildInfoDescs</i> array.  Set to 0 if no post-build info is needed.

### -param pPostbuildInfoDescs [in]

Optional array of descriptions for post-build info to generate describing properties of the acceleration structure that was built.

## -remarks

This method can be called on graphics or compute command lists but not from bundles.

Post-build information can also be obtained separately from an already built acceleration structure by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12graphicscommandlist4-emitraytracingaccelerationstructurepostbuildinfo">EmitRaytracingAccelerationStructurePostbuildInfo</a>.  The advantage of generating post-build info along with a build is that a barrier isn’t needed in between the build completing and requesting post-build information, enabling scenarios where the app needs the post-build info right away.
