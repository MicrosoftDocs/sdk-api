# D3D12_TEXTURE_ADDRESS_MODE enumeration


## -description


Identifies a technique for resolving texture coordinates that are outside of the boundaries of a texture.
        


## -enum-fields




### -field D3D12_TEXTURE_ADDRESS_MODE_WRAP

Tile the texture at every (u,v) integer junction.
            For example, for u values between 0 and 3, the texture is repeated three times.
          


### -field D3D12_TEXTURE_ADDRESS_MODE_MIRROR

Flip the texture at every (u,v) integer junction.
            For u values between 0 and 1, for example, the texture is addressed normally; between 1 and 2, the texture is flipped (mirrored); between 2 and 3, the texture is normal again; and so on.
          


### -field D3D12_TEXTURE_ADDRESS_MODE_CLAMP

Texture coordinates outside the range [0.0, 1.0] are set to the texture color at 0.0 or 1.0, respectively.
          


### -field D3D12_TEXTURE_ADDRESS_MODE_BORDER

Texture coordinates outside the range [0.0, 1.0] are set to the border color specified in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_sampler_desc">D3D12_SAMPLER_DESC</a> or HLSL code.
          


### -field D3D12_TEXTURE_ADDRESS_MODE_MIRROR_ONCE

Similar to 
            <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ne-d3d12-d3d12_texture_address_mode">D3D12_TEXTURE_ADDRESS_MODE_MIRROR</a> 
            and 
            <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ne-d3d12-d3d12_texture_address_mode">D3D12_TEXTURE_ADDRESS_MODE_CLAMP</a>.
            Takes the absolute value of the texture coordinate (thus, mirroring around 0), and then clamps to the maximum value.
          


## -remarks



This enum is used by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_sampler_desc">D3D12_SAMPLER_DESC</a> structure.
