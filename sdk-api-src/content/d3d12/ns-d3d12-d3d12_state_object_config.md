# D3D12_STATE_OBJECT_CONFIG structure


## -description


Defines general properties of a state object.


## -struct-fields




### -field Flags

A value from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ne-d3d12-d3d12_state_object_flags">D3D12_STATE_OBJECT_FLAGS</a> flags enumeration that specifies the requirements for the state object.


## -remarks



The presence of this subobject in a state object is optional.  If present, all exports in the state object must be associated with the same subobject (or one with a matching definition).  This consistency requirement does not apply across existing collections that are included in a larger state object.
