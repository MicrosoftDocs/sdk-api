## -parameters




### -param pData [out]

Type: <b>void*</b>

Specifies a pointer to the data. This memory must be readable and writeable up to the input size. This data can be saved and provided to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device1-createpipelinelibrary">CreatePipelineLibrary</a> at a later time, including future instances of this or other processes. The data becomes invalidated if the runtime or driver is updated, and is not portable to other hardware or devices.


### -param DataSizeInBytes

Type: <b>SIZE_T</b>

The size provided must be at least the size returned from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12pipelinelibrary-getserializedsize">GetSerializedSize</a>. 


## -returns



Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/com/structure-of-com-error-codes">HRESULT</a></b>

This method returns an HRESULT success or error code, including E_INVALIDARG if the buffer provided isn’t big enough.
