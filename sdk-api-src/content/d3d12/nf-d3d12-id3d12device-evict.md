# ID3D12Device::Evict


## -description


Enables the page-out of data, which precludes GPU access of that data.


## -parameters




### -param NumObjects

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT</a></b>

The number of objects in the <i>ppObjects</i> array to evict from the device.
          


### -param ppObjects [in]

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nn-d3d12-id3d12pageable">ID3D12Pageable</a>*</b>

A pointer to a memory block that contains an array of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nn-d3d12-id3d12pageable">ID3D12Pageable</a> interface pointers for the objects.
          

Even though most D3D12 objects inherit from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nn-d3d12-id3d12pageable">ID3D12Pageable</a>, residency changes are only supported on the following objects:
Descriptor Heaps, Heaps, Committed Resources, and Query Heaps


## -returns



Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/com/structure-of-com-error-codes">HRESULT</a></b>

This method returns one of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d12/d3d12-graphics-reference-returnvalues">Direct3D 12 Return Codes</a>.
          




## -remarks



<b>Evict</b> persists the data associated with a resource to disk, and then removes the resource from the memory pool where it was located. This method should be called on the object which owns the physical memory: either a committed resource (which owns both virtual  and physical memory assignments) or a heap - noting that reserved resources do not have physical memory, and placed resources are borrowing memory from a heap.


Refer to the remarks for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-makeresident">MakeResident</a>.
