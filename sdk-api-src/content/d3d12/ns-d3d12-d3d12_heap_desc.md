# D3D12_HEAP_DESC structure


## -description

Describes a heap.

## -struct-fields

### -field SizeInBytes

The size, in bytes, of the heap.
            To avoid wasting memory, applications should pass <i>SizeInBytes</i> values which are multiples of the effective <i>Alignment</i>;
            but non-aligned <i>SizeInBytes</i> is also supported, for convenience.
            To find out how large a heap must be to support textures with undefined layouts and adapter-specific sizes, call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-getresourceallocationinfo">ID3D12Device::GetResourceAllocationInfo</a>.

### -field Properties

A <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_heap_properties">D3D12_HEAP_PROPERTIES</a> structure that describes the heap properties.

### -field Alignment

The alignment value for the heap.  Valid values:
            

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0
                </td>
<td>An alias for 64KB.
                </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D3D12_DEFAULT_RESOURCE_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT
                </td>
<td>#defined as 64KB.
                </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D3D12_DEFAULT_MSAA_RESOURCE_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT
                </td>
<td>#defined as 4MB.
                  An application must decide whether the heap will contain multi-sample anti-aliasing (MSAA), in which case, the application must choose D3D12_DEFAULT_MSAA_RESOURCE_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT.
                </td>
</tr>
</table>

### -field Flags

A combination of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ne-d3d12-d3d12_heap_flags">D3D12_HEAP_FLAGS</a>-typed values that are combined by using a bitwise-OR operation.
            The resulting value identifies heap options.
            When creating heaps to support adapters with resource heap tier 1, an application must choose some flags.

## -remarks

This structure is used by the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createheap">CreateHeap</a> method, and returned by the <a href="/windows/desktop/direct3d12/id3d12heap-getdesc">GetDesc</a> method.
