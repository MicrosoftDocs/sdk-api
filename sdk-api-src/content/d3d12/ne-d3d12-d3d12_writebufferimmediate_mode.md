# D3D12_WRITEBUFFERIMMEDIATE_MODE enumeration


## -description


Specifies the mode used by a <b>WriteBufferImmediate</b> operation.


## -enum-fields




### -field D3D12_WRITEBUFFERIMMEDIATE_MODE_DEFAULT

The write operation behaves the same as normal copy-write operations.


### -field D3D12_WRITEBUFFERIMMEDIATE_MODE_MARKER_IN

The write operation is guaranteed to occur after all preceding commands in the command stream have started, including previous <b>WriteBufferImmediate</b> operations.


### -field D3D12_WRITEBUFFERIMMEDIATE_MODE_MARKER_OUT

The write operation is deferred until all previous commands in the command stream have completed through the GPU pipeline, including previous <b>WriteBufferImmediate</b> operations. Write operations that specify <b>D3D12_WRITEBUFFERIMMEDIATE_MODE_MARKER_OUT</b> don't block subsequent operations from starting. If there are no previous operations in the command stream, then the write operation behaves as if <b>D3D12_WRITEBUFFERIMMEDIATE_MODE_MARKER_IN</b> was specified.
