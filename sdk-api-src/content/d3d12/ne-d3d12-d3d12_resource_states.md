## -description

Defines constants that specify the state of a resource regarding how the resource is being used.

## -enum-fields

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_COMMON:0

Your application should transition to this state only for accessing a resource across different graphics engine types.

Specifically, a resource must be in the COMMON state before being used on a COPY queue (when previously used on DIRECT/COMPUTE), and before being used on DIRECT/COMPUTE (when previously used on COPY). This restriction doesn't exist when accessing data between DIRECT and COMPUTE queues.

The COMMON state can be used for all usages on a Copy queue using the implicit state transitions. For more info, in <a href="/windows/win32/direct3d12/user-mode-heap-synchronization">Multi-engine synchronization</a>, find "common".

Additionally, textures must be in the COMMON state for CPU access to be legal, assuming the texture was created in a CPU-visible heap in the first place.

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_VERTEX_AND_CONSTANT_BUFFER:0x1

A subresource must be in this state when it is accessed by the GPU as a vertex buffer or constant buffer. This is a read-only state.

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_INDEX_BUFFER:0x2

A subresource must be in this state when it is accessed by the 3D pipeline as an index buffer. This is a read-only state.

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_RENDER_TARGET:0x4

The resource is used as a render target. A subresource must be in this state when it is rendered to, or when it is cleared with <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12graphicscommandlist-clearrendertargetview">ID3D12GraphicsCommandList::ClearRenderTargetView</a>.

This is a write-only state. To read from a render target as a shader resource, the resource must be in either **D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_NON_PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE** or **D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE**.

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_UNORDERED_ACCESS:0x8

The resource is used for unordered access. A subresource must be in this state when it is accessed by the GPU via an unordered access view. A subresource must also be in this state when it is cleared with <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12graphicscommandlist-clearunorderedaccessviewuint">ID3D12GraphicsCommandList::ClearUnorderedAccessViewInt</a> or <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12graphicscommandlist-clearunorderedaccessviewfloat">ID3D12GraphicsCommandList::ClearUnorderedAccessViewFloat</a>. This is a read/write state.

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_DEPTH_WRITE:0x10

**D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_DEPTH_WRITE** is a state that is mutually exclusive with other states. You should use it for <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12graphicscommandlist-cleardepthstencilview">ID3D12GraphicsCommandList::ClearDepthStencilView</a> when the flags (see <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d12/ne-d3d12-d3d12_clear_flags">D3D12_CLEAR_FLAGS</a>) indicate a given subresource should be cleared (otherwise the subresource state doesn't matter), or when using it in a writable depth stencil view (see <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d12/ne-d3d12-d3d12_dsv_flags">D3D12_DSV_FLAGS</a>) when the PSO has depth write enabled (see <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_depth_stencil_desc">D3D12_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC</a>).

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_DEPTH_READ:0x20

DEPTH_READ is a state that can be combined with other states. It should be used when the subresource is in a read-only depth stencil view, or when depth write of <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_depth_stencil_desc">D3D12_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC</a> is disabled. It can be combined with other read states (for example, **D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE**), such that the resource can be used for the depth or stencil test, and accessed by a shader within the same draw call. Using it when depth will be written by a draw call or clear command is invalid.

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_NON_PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE:0x40

The resource is used with a shader other than the pixel shader. A subresource must be in this state before being read by any stage (except for the pixel shader stage) via a shader resource view. You can still use the resource in a pixel shader with this flag as long as it also has the flag **D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE** set. This is a read-only state.

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE:0x80

The resource is used with a pixel shader. A subresource must be in this state before being read by the pixel shader via a shader resource view. This is a read-only state.

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_STREAM_OUT:0x100

The resource is used with stream output. A subresource must be in this state when it is accessed by the 3D pipeline as a stream-out target. This is a write-only state.

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_INDIRECT_ARGUMENT:0x200

            The resource is used as an indirect argument.
            Subresources must be in this state when they are used as the argument buffer passed to the indirect drawing method <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12graphicscommandlist-executeindirect">ID3D12GraphicsCommandList::ExecuteIndirect</a>.
            This is a read-only state.

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_COPY_DEST:0x400

            The resource is used as the destination in a copy operation.
            Subresources must be in this state when they are used as the destination of copy operation, or a blt operation.
            This is a write-only state.

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_COPY_SOURCE:0x800

            The resource is used as the source in a copy operation.
            Subresources must be in this state when they are used as the source of copy operation, or a blt operation.
            This is a read-only state.

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_RESOLVE_DEST:0x1000

            The resource is used as the destination in a resolve operation.

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_RESOLVE_SOURCE:0x2000

            The resource is used as the source in a resolve operation.

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_RAYTRACING_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE:0x400000

When a buffer is created with this as its initial state, it indicates that the resource is a raytracing acceleration structure, for use in <a href="nf-d3d12-id3d12graphicscommandlist4-buildraytracingaccelerationstructure.md">ID3D12GraphicsCommandList4::BuildRaytracingAccelerationStructure</a>, <a href="nf-d3d12-id3d12graphicscommandlist4-copyraytracingaccelerationstructure.md">ID3D12GraphicsCommandList4::CopyRaytracingAccelerationStructure</a>, or <a href="nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createshaderresourceview.md">ID3D12Device::CreateShaderResourceView</a> for the <a href="ne-d3d12-d3d12_srv_dimension.md">D3D12_SRV_DIMENSION_RAYTRACING_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE</a> dimension.

> [!NOTE]
> A resource to be used for the **D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_RAYTRACING_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE** state must be created in that state, and then never transitioned out of it. Nor may a resource that was created not in that state be transitioned into it. For more info, see [Acceleration structure memory restrictions](https://microsoft.github.io/DirectX-Specs/d3d/Raytracing.html#acceleration-structure-memory-restrictions) in the DirectX raytracing (DXR) functional specification on GitHub.

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_SHADING_RATE_SOURCE:0x1000000

Starting with Windows 10, version 1903 (10.0; Build 18362), indicates that the resource is a screen-space shading-rate image for variable-rate shading (VRS). For more info, see <a href="/windows/win32/direct3d12/vrs">Variable-rate shading (VRS)</a>.

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_GENERIC_READ

D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_GENERIC_READ is a logically OR'd combination of other read-state bits. This is the required starting state for an upload heap. Your application should generally avoid transitioning to D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_GENERIC_READ when possible, since that can result in premature cache flushes, or resource layout changes (for example, compress/decompress), causing unnecessary pipeline stalls. You should instead transition resources only to the actually-used states.

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_PRESENT:0

            Synonymous with D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_COMMON.

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_PREDICATION:0x200

            The resource is used for <a href="/windows/win32/direct3d12/predication">Predication</a>.

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_VIDEO_DECODE_READ:0x10000

            The resource is used as a source in a decode operation. Examples include reading the compressed bitstream and reading from decode references,

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_VIDEO_DECODE_WRITE:0x20000

            The resource is used as a destination in the decode operation. This state is used for decode output and histograms.

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_VIDEO_PROCESS_READ:0x40000

            The resource is used to read video data during video processing; that is, the resource is used as the source in a processing operation such as video encoding (compression).

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_VIDEO_PROCESS_WRITE:0x80000

            The resource is used to write video data during video processing; that is, the resource is used as the destination in a processing operation such as video encoding (compression).

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_VIDEO_ENCODE_READ:0x200000

        
            The resource is used as the source in an encode operation. This state is used for the input and reference of motion estimation.

### -field D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_VIDEO_ENCODE_WRITE:0x800000

            This resource is used as the destination in an encode operation. This state is used for the destination texture of a resolve motion vector heap operation.
