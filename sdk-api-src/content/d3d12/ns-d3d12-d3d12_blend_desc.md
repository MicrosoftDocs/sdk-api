## -description

Describes the blend state.

## -struct-fields

### -field AlphaToCoverageEnable

Specifies whether to use alpha-to-coverage as a multisampling technique when setting a pixel to a render target. For more info about using alpha-to-coverage, see <a href="/windows/desktop/direct3d11/d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-blend-state">Alpha-To-Coverage</a>.

### -field IndependentBlendEnable

Specifies whether to enable independent blending in simultaneous render targets. Set to <b>TRUE</b> to enable independent blending. If set to <b>FALSE</b>, only the <b>RenderTarget</b>[0] members are used; <b>RenderTarget</b>[1..7] are ignored.

See the **Remarks** section for restrictions.

### -field RenderTarget

An array of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_render_target_blend_desc">D3D12_RENDER_TARGET_BLEND_DESC</a> structures that describe the blend states for render targets; these correspond to the eight render targets that can be bound to the <a href="/windows/desktop/direct3d11/d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-output-merger-stage">output-merger stage</a> at one time.

## -remarks

A <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_graphics_pipeline_state_desc">D3D12_GRAPHICS_PIPELINE_STATE_DESC</a> object contains a blend-state structure that controls blending by the output-merger stage.

Here are the default values for blend state.

<table>
<tr>
<th>State</th>
<th>Default Value</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AlphaToCoverageEnable</td>
<td><b>FALSE</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IndependentBlendEnable</td>
<td><b>FALSE</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RenderTarget[0].BlendEnable</td>
<td><b>FALSE</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RenderTarget[0].LogicOpEnable</td>
<td><b>FALSE</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RenderTarget[0].SrcBlend</td>
<td>D3D12_BLEND_ONE</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RenderTarget[0].DestBlend</td>
<td>D3D12_BLEND_ZERO</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RenderTarget[0].BlendOp</td>
<td>D3D12_BLEND_OP_ADD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RenderTarget[0].SrcBlendAlpha</td>
<td>D3D12_BLEND_ONE</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RenderTarget[0].DestBlendAlpha</td>
<td>D3D12_BLEND_ZERO</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RenderTarget[0].BlendOpAlpha</td>
<td>D3D12_BLEND_OP_ADD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RenderTarget[0].LogicOp</td>
<td>D3D12_LOGIC_OP_NOOP</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RenderTarget[0].RenderTargetWriteMask</td>
<td>D3D12_COLOR_WRITE_ENABLE_ALL</td>
</tr>
</table>

When you set the <b>LogicOpEnable</b> member of the first element of the <b>RenderTarget</b> array (<b>RenderTarget</b>[0]) to <b>TRUE</b>, you must also set the <b>BlendEnable</b> member of <b>RenderTarget</b>[0] to <b>FALSE</b>, and the <b>IndependentBlendEnable</b> member of this structure to <b>FALSE</b>. This reflects the limitation in hardware that you can't mix logic operations with blending across multiple render targets, and that when you use a logic operation, you must apply the same logic operation to all render targets.

Note the helper structure, <a href="/windows/desktop/direct3d12/cd3dx12-blend-desc">CD3DX12_BLEND_DESC</a>.
