# D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_DESC structure


## -description


Describes a command queue.


## -struct-fields




### -field Type

Specifies one member of <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d12/ne-d3d12-d3d12_command_list_type">D3D12_COMMAND_LIST_TYPE</a>.
          


### -field Priority

The priority for the command queue, as a 
            <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d12/ne-d3d12-d3d12_command_queue_priority">D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_PRIORITY</a>enumeration constant to select normal or high priority.
          


### -field Flags

Specifies any flags from the <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d12/ne-d3d12-d3d12_command_queue_flags">D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_FLAGS</a> enumeration.
          


### -field NodeMask

For single GPU operation, set this to zero. If there are multiple GPU nodes, set a bit to identify the node (the  device's physical adapter) to which the command queue applies.
            Each bit in the mask corresponds to a single node.
            Only 1 bit must be set.
          Refer to <a href="/windows/win32/direct3d12/multi-engine">Multi-adapter systems</a>.
