# D3D12_EXPORT_DESC structure


## -description


Describes an export from a state subobject such as a DXIL library or a collection state object.


## -struct-fields




### -field Name

The name to be exported.  If the name refers to a function that is overloaded, a modified version of the name (e.g. encoding function parameter information  in name string) can be provided to disambiguate which overload to use.  The modified name for a function can be retrieved using HLSL compiler reflection.

If the <i>ExportToRename</i> field is non-null, <i>Name</i> refers to the new name to use for it when exported.  In this case <i>Name</i> must be the unmodified name, whereas <i>ExportToRename</i> can be either a modified or unmodified name.  A given internal name may be exported multiple times with different renames (and/or not renamed). 


### -field ExportToRename

If non-null, this is the name of an export to use but then rename when exported.  



#### Flags

The flags to apply to the export.
