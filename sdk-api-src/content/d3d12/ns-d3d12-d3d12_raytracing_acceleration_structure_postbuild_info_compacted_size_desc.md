# D3D12_RAYTRACING_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_POSTBUILD_INFO_COMPACTED_SIZE_DESC structure


## -description

Describes the space requirement for acceleration structure after compaction.

## -struct-fields

### -field CompactedSizeInBytes

The space requirement for acceleration structure after compaction.

It is guaranteed that a compacted acceleration structure doesnâ€™t consume more space than a non-compacted acceleration structure.

Pre-compaction, it is guaranteed that the size requirements reported by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device5-getraytracingaccelerationstructureprebuildinfo">GetRaytracingAccelerationStructurePrebuildInfo</a> for a given build configuration (triangle counts etc.) will be sufficient to store any acceleration structure whose build inputs are reduced (e.g. reducing triangle counts).  This non-increasing property for smaller builds does not apply post-compaction, however.  In other words, it is not guaranteed that having fewer items in an acceleration structure means it compresses to a smaller size than compressing an acceleration structure with more items.
