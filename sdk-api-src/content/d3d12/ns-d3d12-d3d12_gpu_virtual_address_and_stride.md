# D3D12_GPU_VIRTUAL_ADDRESS_AND_STRIDE structure


## -description


Represents a GPU virtual address and indexing stride.


## -struct-fields




### -field StartAddress

The beginning of the virtual address range.


### -field StrideInBytes

Defines indexing stride, such as for vertices.  Only the bottom 32 bits are used.  The field is 64 bits to make alignment of containing structures consistent everywhere.
