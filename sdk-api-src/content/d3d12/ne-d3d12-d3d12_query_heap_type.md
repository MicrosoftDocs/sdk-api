# D3D12_QUERY_HEAP_TYPE enumeration

## -description

Specifies the type of query heap to create.

## -enum-fields

### -field D3D12_QUERY_HEAP_TYPE_OCCLUSION

This returns a binary 0/1 result:  0 indicates that no samples passed depth and stencil testing, 1 indicates that at least one sample passed depth and stencil testing.  This enables occlusion queries to not interfere with any GPU performance optimization associated with depth/stencil testing.  

### -field D3D12_QUERY_HEAP_TYPE_TIMESTAMP

Indicates that the heap is for high-performance timing data. 

### -field D3D12_QUERY_HEAP_TYPE_PIPELINE_STATISTICS

Indicates the heap is to contain pipeline data. Refer to <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_query_data_pipeline_statistics">D3D12_QUERY_DATA_PIPELINE_STATISTICS</a>.

### -field D3D12_QUERY_HEAP_TYPE_SO_STATISTICS

Indicates the heap is to contain stream output data. Refer to <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_query_data_so_statistics">D3D12_QUERY_DATA_SO_STATISTICS</a>.

### -field D3D12_QUERY_HEAP_TYPE_VIDEO_DECODE_STATISTICS

Indicates the heap is to contain video decode statistics data. Refer to [D3D12_QUERY_DATA_VIDEO_DECODE_STATISTICS](/windows/win32/api/d3d12video/ns-d3d12video-d3d12_query_data_video_decode_statistics).

Video decode statistics can only be queried from video decode command lists (<a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d12/ne-d3d12-d3d12_command_list_type">D3D12_COMMAND_LIST_TYPE_VIDEO_DECODE</a>). See <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d12/ne-d3d12-d3d12_query_type">D3D12_QUERY_TYPE_DECODE_STATISTICS</a> for more details.

### -field D3D12_QUERY_HEAP_TYPE_COPY_QUEUE_TIMESTAMP

Indicates the heap is to contain timestamp queries emitted exclusively by copy command lists. Copy queue timestamps can only be queried from a copy command list, and a copy command list can not emit to a regular timestamp query Heap.

Support for this query heap type is not universal. You must use <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-checkfeaturesupport">CheckFeatureSupport</a> with [D3D12_FEATURE_D3D12_OPTIONS3](/windows/win32/api/d3d12/ne-d3d12-d3d12_feature) to determine whether the adapter supports copy queue timestamp queries.

## -remarks

This enum is used by the <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_query_heap_desc">D3D12_QUERY_HEAP_DESC</a> structure.
