## -description


Describes the properties of a ray dispatch operation initiated with a call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12graphicscommandlist4-dispatchrays">ID3D12GraphicsCommandList4::DispatchRays</a>.


## -struct-fields




### -field RayGenerationShaderRecord

The shader record for the ray generation shader to use.  

The memory pointed to must be in state <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ne-d3d12-d3d12_resource_states">D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_NON_PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE</a>.  

The address must be aligned to 64 bytes, defined as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d12/constants">D3D12_RAYTRACING_SHADER_TABLE_BYTE_ALIGNMENT</a>, and in the range [0...4096] bytes. 


### -field MissShaderTable

The shader table for miss shaders.

The stride is record stride, and must be aligned to 32 bytes, defined as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d12/constants">D3D12_RAYTRACING_SHADER_RECORD_BYTE_ALIGNMENT</a>, and in the range [0...4096] bytes. 0 is allowed.
