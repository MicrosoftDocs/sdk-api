# ID3D12PipelineLibrary1::LoadPipeline


## -description

Retrieves the requested PSO from the library. The pipeline stream description is matched against the library database and remembered in order to prevent duplication of PSO contents.

## -parameters

### -param pName [in]

Type: <b>LPCWSTR</b>

<a href="/visualstudio/code-quality/annotating-function-parameters-and-return-values?view=vs-2015">SAL</a>: <code>_In_</code>

The unique name of the PSO.

### -param pDesc [in]

Type: <b>const <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_pipeline_state_stream_desc">D3D12_PIPELINE_STATE_STREAM_DESC</a>*</b>

<a href="/visualstudio/code-quality/annotating-function-parameters-and-return-values?view=vs-2015">SAL</a>: <code>_In_</code>

Describes the required PSO using a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_pipeline_state_stream_desc">D3D12_PIPELINE_STATE_STREAM_DESC</a> structure. This description is matched against the library database and stored in order to prevent duplication of PSO contents.

### -param riid

Type: <b>REFIID</b>

Specifies a REFIID for the ID3D12PipelineStateState object.

Applications should typically set this argument and the following argument, ppPipelineState, by using the macro IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;PSO1), where PSO1 is the name of the object.

### -param ppPipelineState [out]

Type: <b>void**</b>

<a href="/visualstudio/code-quality/annotating-function-parameters-and-return-values?view=vs-2015">SAL</a>: <code>_COM_Outptr_</code>

Specifies the pointer that will reference the PSO after the function successfully returns.

## -returns

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/com/structure-of-com-error-codes">HRESULT</a></b>

This method returns an HRESULT success or error code, which can include E_INVALIDARG if the name doesn't exist or the stream description doesn't match the data in the library, and E_OUTOFMEMORY if the function is unable to allocate the resulting PSO.

## -remarks

This function takes the pipeline description as a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_pipeline_state_stream_desc">D3D12_PIPELINE_STATE_STREAM_DESC</a> and is a replacement for the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12pipelinelibrary-loadgraphicspipeline">ID3D12PipelineLibrary::LoadGraphicsPipeline</a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12pipelinelibrary-loadcomputepipeline">ID3D12PipelineLibrary::LoadComputePipeline</a> functions, which take their pipeline description as the less-flexible <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_graphics_pipeline_state_desc">D3D12_GRAPHICS_PIPELINE_STATE_DESC</a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_compute_pipeline_state_desc">D3D12_COMPUTE_PIPELINE_STATE_DESC</a> structs, respectively.
