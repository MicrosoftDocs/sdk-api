# D3D12_CPU_PAGE_PROPERTY enumeration


## -description


Specifies the CPU-page properties for the heap.


## -enum-fields




### -field D3D12_CPU_PAGE_PROPERTY_UNKNOWN

The CPU-page property is unknown.


### -field D3D12_CPU_PAGE_PROPERTY_NOT_AVAILABLE

The CPU cannot access the heap, therefore no page properties are available.
          


### -field D3D12_CPU_PAGE_PROPERTY_WRITE_COMBINE

The CPU-page property is write-combined.


### -field D3D12_CPU_PAGE_PROPERTY_WRITE_BACK

The CPU-page property is write-back.


## -remarks
