## -struct-fields




### -field DXILLibrary

The library to include in the state object.  Must have been compiled with library target 6.3 or higher.  It is fine to specify the same library multiple times either in the same state object / collection or across multiple, as long as the names exported each time donâ€™t conflict in a given state object.


### -field NumExports

The size of <i>pExports</i> array.  If 0, everything gets exported from the library.



#### pExports

Optional exports array.  For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_export_desc">D3D12_EXPORT_DESC</a>.
