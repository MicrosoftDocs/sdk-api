# D3D12_SUBOBJECT_TO_EXPORTS_ASSOCIATION structure


## -description

Associates a subobject defined directly in a state object with shader exports.

## -struct-fields

### -field pSubobjectToAssociate

Pointer to the subobject in current state object to define an association to.

### -field NumExports

Size of the <i>pExports</i> array.  If 0, this is being explicitly defined as a default association.  Another way to define a default association is to omit this subobject association for that subobject completely.

### -field pExports

The array of exports with which the subobject is associated.

## -remarks

Depending on the flags specified in the optional <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_state_object_config">D3D12_STATE_OBJECT_CONFIG</a> subobject for opting into cross linkage, the exports being associated donâ€™t necessarily have to be present in the current state object, or one that has been seen yet, to be resolved later, on raytracing pipeline state object (RTPSO) creation for example.
