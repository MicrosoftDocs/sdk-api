# ID3D12MetaCommand interface


## -description

Represents a meta command. A meta command is a Direct3D 12 object representing an algorithm that is accelerated by independent hardware vendors (IHVs). It's an opaque reference to a command generator that is implemented by the driver.

The lifetime of a meta command is tied to the lifetime of the command list that references it. So, you should only free a meta command if no command list referencing it is currently executing on the GPU.

A meta command can encapsulate a set of pipeline state objects (PSOs), bindings, intermediate resource states, and Draw/Dispatch calls. You can think of the signature of a meta command as being similar to a C-style function, with multiple in/out parameters, and no return value.
