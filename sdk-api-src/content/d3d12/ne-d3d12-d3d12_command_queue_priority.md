# D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_PRIORITY enumeration


## -description

Defines priority levels for a command queue.

## -enum-fields

### -field D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_PRIORITY_NORMAL

Normal priority.

### -field D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH

High priority.

### -field D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_PRIORITY_GLOBAL_REALTIME

Global realtime priority.

## -remarks

This enumeration is used by the <b>Priority</b> member of the
          <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_command_queue_desc">D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_DESC</a>structure.
        

An application must be sufficiently privileged in order to create a command queue that has global realtime priority. If the application is not sufficiently privileged or if neither the adapter or driver can provide the necessary preemption, then requests to create a global realtime priority queue fail; such a failure could be due to a lack of hardware support or due to conflicts with other command queue parameters. Requests to create a global realtime command queue won't silently downgrade the priority when it can't be supported; the request succeeds or fails as-is to indicate to the application whether or not the command queue is guaranteed to execute before any other queue.
