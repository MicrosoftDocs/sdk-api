# D3D12_BLEND enumeration


## -description

Specifies blend factors, which modulate values for the pixel shader and render target.

## -enum-fields

### -field D3D12_BLEND_ZERO:1

The blend factor is (0, 0, 0, 0). No pre-blend operation.

### -field D3D12_BLEND_ONE:2

The blend factor is (1, 1, 1, 1). No pre-blend operation.

### -field D3D12_BLEND_SRC_COLOR:3

The blend factor is (Rₛ, Gₛ, Bₛ, Aₛ), that is color data (RGB) from a pixel shader. No pre-blend operation.

### -field D3D12_BLEND_INV_SRC_COLOR:4

The blend factor is (1 - Rₛ, 1 - Gₛ, 1 - Bₛ, 1 - Aₛ), that is color data (RGB) from a pixel shader. The pre-blend operation inverts the data, generating 1 - RGB.

### -field D3D12_BLEND_SRC_ALPHA:5

The blend factor is (Aₛ, Aₛ, Aₛ, Aₛ), that is alpha data (A) from a pixel shader. No pre-blend operation.

### -field D3D12_BLEND_INV_SRC_ALPHA:6

The blend factor is ( 1 - Aₛ, 1 - Aₛ, 1 - Aₛ, 1 - Aₛ), that is alpha data (A) from a pixel shader. The pre-blend operation inverts the data, generating 1 - A.

### -field D3D12_BLEND_DEST_ALPHA:7

The blend factor is (A<sub>d</sub> A<sub>d</sub> A<sub>d</sub> A<sub>d</sub>), that is alpha data from a render target. No pre-blend operation.

### -field D3D12_BLEND_INV_DEST_ALPHA:8

The blend factor is (1 - A<sub>d</sub> 1 - A<sub>d</sub> 1 - A<sub>d</sub> 1 - A<sub>d</sub>), that is alpha data from a render target. The pre-blend operation inverts the data, generating 1 - A.

### -field D3D12_BLEND_DEST_COLOR:9

The blend factor is (R<sub>d</sub>, G<sub>d</sub>, B<sub>d</sub>, A<sub>d</sub>), that is color data from a render target. No pre-blend operation.

### -field D3D12_BLEND_INV_DEST_COLOR:10

The blend factor is (1 - R<sub>d</sub>, 1 - G<sub>d</sub>, 1 - B<sub>d</sub>, 1 - A<sub>d</sub>), that is color data from a render target. The pre-blend operation inverts the data, generating 1 - RGB.

### -field D3D12_BLEND_SRC_ALPHA_SAT:11

The blend factor is (f, f, f, 1); where f = min(Aₛ, 1
    - A<sub>d</sub>). The pre-blend operation clamps the data to 1 or less.

### -field D3D12_BLEND_BLEND_FACTOR:14

The blend factor is the blend factor set with <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12graphicscommandlist-omsetblendfactor">ID3D12GraphicsCommandList::OMSetBlendFactor</a>. No pre-blend operation.

### -field D3D12_BLEND_INV_BLEND_FACTOR:15

The blend factor is the blend factor set with <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12graphicscommandlist-omsetblendfactor">ID3D12GraphicsCommandList::OMSetBlendFactor</a>. The pre-blend operation inverts the blend factor, generating 1 - blend_factor.

### -field D3D12_BLEND_SRC1_COLOR:16

The blend factor is data sources both as color data output by a pixel shader. There is no pre-blend operation. This blend factor supports dual-source color blending.

### -field D3D12_BLEND_INV_SRC1_COLOR:17

The blend factor is data sources both as color data output by a pixel shader. The pre-blend operation inverts the data, generating 1 - RGB. This blend factor supports dual-source color blending.

### -field D3D12_BLEND_SRC1_ALPHA:18

The blend factor is data sources as alpha data output by a pixel shader. There is no pre-blend operation. This blend factor supports dual-source color blending.

### -field D3D12_BLEND_INV_SRC1_ALPHA:19

The blend factor is data sources as alpha data output by a pixel shader. The pre-blend operation inverts the data, generating 1 - A. This blend factor supports dual-source color blending.

### -field D3D12_BLEND_ALPHA_FACTOR:20

The blend factor is (A, A, A, A), where the constant, A, is taken from the blend factor set with [OMSetBlendFactor](/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12graphicscommandlist-omsetblendfactor).

To successfully use this constant on a target machine, the [D3D12_FEATURE_DATA_D3D12_OPTIONS13](ns-d3d12-d3d12_feature_data_d3d12_options13.md) returned from [capability querying](/windows/win32/direct3d12/capability-querying) must have its *AlphaBlendFactorSupported* set to `TRUE`.

### -field D3D12_BLEND_INV_ALPHA_FACTOR:21

The blend factor is (1 – A, 1 – A, 1 – A, 1 – A), where the constant, A, is taken from the blend factor set with [OMSetBlendFactor](/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12graphicscommandlist-omsetblendfactor).

To successfully use this constant on a target machine, the [D3D12_FEATURE_DATA_D3D12_OPTIONS13](ns-d3d12-d3d12_feature_data_d3d12_options13.md) returned from [capability querying](/windows/win32/direct3d12/capability-querying) must have its *AlphaBlendFactorSupported* set to `TRUE`.

## -remarks

Source and destination blend operations are specified in a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_render_target_blend_desc">D3D12_RENDER_TARGET_BLEND_DESC</a> structure.
