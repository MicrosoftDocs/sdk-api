# D3D12_AUTO_BREADCRUMB_NODE structure


## -description

Represents Device Removed Extended Data (DRED) auto-breadcrumb data as a node in a linked list. Each **D3D12_AUTO_BREADCRUMB_NODE** object is singly linked to the next via its `pNext` member; except for the last node in the list, which has its `pNext` set to `nullptr`.

The Direct3D 12 runtime creates one of these for each graphics command list, and tracks them in the command allocator associated with the list. When a command list is executed, the command queue information is set. After device removal is detected, the Direct3D 12 runtime links together the auto-breadcrumb nodes for any GPU work that is still outstanding.

## -struct-fields

### -field pCommandListDebugNameA

A pointer to the ANSI debug name of the outstanding command list (if any).

### -field pCommandListDebugNameW

A pointer to the wide debug name of the outstanding command list (if any).

### -field pCommandQueueDebugNameA

A pointer to the ANSI debug name of the outstanding command queue (if any).

### -field pCommandQueueDebugNameW

A pointer to the wide debug name of the outstanding command queue (if any).

### -field pCommandList

A pointer to the [ID3D12GraphicsCommandList interface](nn-d3d12-id3d12graphicscommandlist.md) representing the outstanding command list at the time of execution.

### -field pCommandQueue

A pointer to the [ID3D12CommandQueue interface](nn-d3d12-id3d12commandqueue.md) representing the outstanding command queue.

### -field BreadcrumbCount

A **UINT32** containing the count of [D3D12_AUTO_BREADCRUMB_OP](ne-d3d12-d3d12_auto_breadcrumb_op.md) values in the array pointed to by `pCommandHistory`.

### -field pLastBreadcrumbValue

A pointer to a constant **UINT32** containing the index (within the array pointed to by `pCommandHistory`) of the last render/compute operation that was completed by the GPU while executing the associated command list.

### -field pCommandHistory

A pointer to a constant array of [D3D12_AUTO_BREADCRUMB_OP](ne-d3d12-d3d12_auto_breadcrumb_op.md) values representing all of the render/compute operations recorded into the associated command list.

### -field pNext

A pointer to a constant **D3D12_AUTO_BREADCRUMB_NODE** representing the next auto-breadcrumb node in the list, or `nullptr` if this is the last node.
