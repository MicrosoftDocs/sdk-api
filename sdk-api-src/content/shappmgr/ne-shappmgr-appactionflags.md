# APPACTIONFLAGS enumeration


## -description


Specifies application management actions supported by an application publisher. These flags are bitmasks passed to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shappmgr/nf-shappmgr-ishellapp-getpossibleactions">IShellApp::GetPossibleActions</a>.


## -enum-fields




### -field APPACTION_INSTALL

Indicates that the application can be installed. Published applications always set this bit.


### -field APPACTION_UNINSTALL

Not applicable to published applications.


### -field APPACTION_MODIFY

Not applicable to published applications.


### -field APPACTION_REPAIR

Not applicable to published applications.


### -field APPACTION_UPGRADE

Not applicable to published applications.


### -field APPACTION_CANGETSIZE

Not applicable to published applications.


### -field APPACTION_MODIFYREMOVE

Not applicable to published applications.


### -field APPACTION_ADDLATER

Indicates that the application supports scheduled installation.  If this bit is set, then the Control Panel's Add or Remove Programs application presents the user an <b>Add Later</b> button. If you select <b>Add Later</b>, you are prompted to select the desired time of installation. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shappmgr/nf-shappmgr-ipublishedapp-install">IPublishedApp::Install</a> method is then called with the installation time.


### -field APPACTION_UNSCHEDULE

Obsolete.


## -remarks



The Add or Remove Programs application in Control Panel uses only <b><b>APPACTION_INSTALL</b></b> and <b><b>APPACTION_ADDLATER</b></b> for published applications.
