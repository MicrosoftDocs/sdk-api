# IFsiFileItem2 interface


## -description

Use this interface to add, remove and enumerate named streams associated with a file. This interface also provides  access to the 'Real-Time' attribute of a file.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IFsiFileItem2</b> interface inherits from <a href="/windows/desktop/api/imapi2fs/nn-imapi2fs-ifsifileitem">IFsiFileItem</a>. <b>IFsiFileItem2</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

While UDF 2.0 is the lowest required revision for named stream support, the user must enable UDF  2.01 or higher to enable the use of both named streams and   real-time file attributes.


The recipients of a storage medium containing such files are required to read them using special MMC commands reducing read latency and increasing the worst-case read speed.

This interface is supported in Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1), Windows XP with Service Pack 2 (SP2),  and Windows Vista  via the Windows Feature Pack for Storage. All  features provided by this  update package are supported natively in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.
