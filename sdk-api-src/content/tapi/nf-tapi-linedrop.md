# lineDrop function


## -description

The 
<b>lineDrop</b> function drops or disconnects the specified call. The application has the option to specify user-user information to be transmitted as part of the call disconnect.

## -parameters

### -param hCall

Handle to the call to be dropped. The application must be an owner of the call. The call state of <i>hCall</i> can be any state except <i>idle</i>.

### -param lpsUserUserInfo

Pointer to a string containing user-user information to be sent to the remote party as part of the call disconnect. This pointer can be left <b>NULL</b> if no user-user information is to be sent. User-user information is only sent if supported by the underlying network (see 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/tapi/ns-tapi-linedevcaps">LINEDEVCAPS</a>). The protocol discriminator field for the user-user information, if required, should appear as the first byte of the buffer pointed to by <i>lpsUserUserInfo</i>, and must be accounted for in <i>dwSize</i>.

### -param dwSize

Size of the user-user information in <i>lpsUserUserInfo</i>, in bytes. If <i>lpsUserUserInfo</i> is <b>NULL</b>, no user-user information is sent to the calling party and <i>dwSize</i> is ignored.

## -returns

Returns a positive request identifier if the function is completed asynchronously, or a negative error number if an error occurs. The <i>dwParam2</i> parameter of the corresponding 
<a href="/windows/desktop/Tapi/line-reply">LINE_REPLY</a> message is zero if the function succeeds or it is a negative error number if an error occurs. Possible return values are:

LINEERR_INVALCALLHANDLE, LINEERR_OPERATIONUNAVAIL, LINEERR_NOMEM, LINEERR_OPERATIONFAILED, LINEERR_NOTOWNER, LINEERR_RESOURCEUNAVAIL, LINEERR_INVALPOINTER, LINEERR_USERUSERINFOTOOBIG, LINEERR_INVALCALLSTATE, LINEERR_UNINITIALIZED.

## -remarks

When invoking 
<b>lineDrop</b>, related calls can sometimes be affected as well. For example, dropping a conference call can drop all individual participating calls. 
<a href="/windows/desktop/Tapi/line-callstate">LINE_CALLSTATE</a> messages are sent to the application for all calls whose call state is affected. A dropped call typically transitions to the <i>idle</i> state. Invoking 
<b>lineDrop</b> on a call in the <i>offering</i> state rejects the call. Not all telephone networks provide this capability.

A call in the <i>onholdpending</i> state typically reverts to the <i>connected</i> state. When dropping the consultation call to the third party for a conference call or when removing the third party in a previously established conference call, the provider (and switch) can release the conference bridge and revert the call back to a normal two-party call. If this is the case, <i>hConfCall</i> transitions to the <i>idle</i> state, and the only remaining participating call transitions to the <i>connected</i> state. Some switches automatically "unhold" the other call.

The application has the option to send user-user information at the time of the drop. Even if user-user information can be sent, there is no guarantee that the network will deliver this information to the remote party.

In various bridged or party-line configurations when multiple parties are on the call, 
<b>lineDrop</b> may not actually clear the call. For example, in a bridged situation, a 
<b>lineDrop</b> operation may not actually drop the call because the status of other stations on the call may govern; instead, the call may simply be changed to the LINECONNECTEDMODE_INACTIVE mode if it remains <i>connected</i> at other stations.
