# lineShutdown function


## -description

The 
<b>lineShutdown</b> function shuts down the application's usage of the line abstraction of the API.

## -parameters

### -param hLineApp

Application's usage handle for the line API.

## -returns

Returns zero if the request succeeds or a negative error number if an error occurs. Possible return values are:

LINEERR_INVALAPPHANDLE, LINEERR_RESOURCEUNAVAIL, LINEERR_NOMEM, LINEERR_UNINITIALIZED.

## -remarks

If this function is called when the application has lines open or calls active, the call handles are deleted and TAPI automatically performs the equivalent of a 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/tapi/nf-tapi-lineclose">lineClose</a> on each open line. However, it is recommended that applications explicitly close all open lines before invoking 
<b>lineShutdown</b>. If shutdown is performed while asynchronous requests are outstanding, those requests are canceled.
