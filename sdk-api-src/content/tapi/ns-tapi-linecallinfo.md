# LINECALLINFO structure


## -description


The 
<b>LINECALLINFO</b> structure contains information about a call. This information remains relatively fixed for the duration of the call. Multiple functions use 
<b>LINECALLINFO</b>. The structure is returned by the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi/nf-tapi-linegetcallinfo">lineGetCallInfo</a> function and the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tspi/nf-tspi-tspi_linegetcallinfo">TSPI_lineGetCallInfo</a> function. If a part of the structure does change, then a 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Tapi/line-callinfo">LINE_CALLINFO</a> message is sent to the application indicating which information item has changed.

Dynamically changing information about a call, such as call progress status, is available in the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi/ns-tapi-linecallstatus">LINECALLSTATUS</a> structure, returned by a call to the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi/nf-tapi-linegetcallstatus">lineGetCallStatus</a> function.


## -struct-fields

Handle to the line device with which this call is associated.


### -field dwLineDeviceID

Device identifier of the line device with which this call is associated.


### -field dwAddressID

Address identifier of the address on the line on which this call exists. An address identifier is permanently associated with an address; the identifier remains constant across operating system upgrades.


### -field dwBearerMode

Current bearer mode of the call. This member uses one of the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Tapi/linebearermode--constants">LINEBEARERMODE_ constants</a>.


### -field dwRate

Rate of the call's data stream, in bps (bits per second).


### -field dwMediaMode

### -field dwCallID

In some telephony environments, the switch or service provider can assign a unique identifier to each call. This allows the call to be tracked across transfers, forwards, or other events. The domain of these call IDs and their scope is service provider-defined. The <b>dwCallID</b> member makes this unique identifier available to the applications.

<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Tapi/linecallparamflags--constants">LINECALLPARAMFLAGS_ constants</a>.


### -field dwCallStates

<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi/nf-tapi-linesetcallparams">lineSetCallParams</a>, their values are the same as the defaults used in the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi/ns-tapi-linedevcaps">LINEDEVCAPS</a> structure.

Specifies the quality of service current in effect in the receiving direction on the call. The provider-specific portion following the <b>FLOWSPEC</b> structure must not contain pointers to other blocks of memory, because TAPI does not know how to marshal the data pointed to by the private pointer(s) and convey it through interprocess communication to the application. The size of the field is specified by <b>dwReceivingFlowspecSize</b>.

### -field dwRedirectionIDAddressType


<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Tapi/lineaddresstype--constants">Address type</a> of the new call destination. This member of the structure is available only if the negotiated TAPI version is 3.0 or higher.


### -field dwRedirectingIDAddressType

## -remarks



Device-specific extensions should use the DevSpecific (<b>dwDevSpecificSize</b> and <b>dwDevSpecificOffset</b>) variably sized area of this data structure.

The 
<b>LINECALLINFO</b> data structure contains relatively fixed information about a call. This structure is returned with 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi/nf-tapi-linegetcallinfo">lineGetCallInfo</a>. When information items in this data structure have changed, a LINE_CALLINFO message is sent to the application. A parameter to this message is the information item or field that changed.

The members <b>dwCallTreatment</b> through <b>dwReceivingFlowspecOffset</b> are available only to applications that open the line device with an API version of 2.0 or later.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The preferred format for specification of the contents of the <b>dwCallID</b> field and the other five similar fields (<b>dwCallerIDFlag</b>, <b>dwCallerIDSize</b>, <b>dwCallerIDOffset</b>, <b>dwCallerIDNameSize</b>, and <b>dwCallerIDNameOffset</b>) is the TAPI canonical number format. For example, a ICLID of "4258828080" received from the switch should be converted to "+1 (425) 8828080" before being placed in the 
<b>LINECALLINFO</b> structure. This standardized format facilitates searching of databases and callback functions implemented in applications.</div>
