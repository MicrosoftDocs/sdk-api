# lineGetAddressID function


## -description

The 
<b>lineGetAddressID</b> function returns the address identifier associated with an address in a different format on the specified line.

## -parameters

### -param hLine

Handle to the open line device.

### -param lpdwAddressID

Pointer to a <b>DWORD</b>-sized memory location where the address identifier is returned. An address identifier is permanently associated with an address; the identifier remains constant across operating system upgrades.

### -param dwAddressMode

Address mode of the address contained in <i>lpsAddress</i>. This parameter uses one and only one of the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/Tapi/lineaddressmode--constants">LINEADDRESSMODE_ Constants</a>. You must specify LINEADDRESSMODE_DIALABLEADDR.

### -param lpsAddress

Pointer to a data structure holding the address assigned to the specified line device. The format of the address is determined by <i>dwAddressMode</i>. Because the only valid value is LINEADDRESSMODE_DIALABLEADDR, <i>lpsAddress</i> uses the common dialable number format and is null-terminated.

### -param dwSize

Size, in bytes, of the address contained in <i>lpsAddress</i>. The size of the string must include the null terminator.

## -returns

Returns zero if the request succeeds or a negative error number if an error occurs. Possible return values are:

LINEERR_INVALLINEHANDLE, LINEERR_OPERATIONUNAVAIL, LINEERR_INVALADDRESSMODE, LINEERR_OPERATIONFAILED, LINEERR_INVALPOINTER, LINEERR_RESOURCEUNAVAIL, LINEERR_INVALADDRESS, LINEERR_UNINITIALIZED, LINEERR_NOMEM.

## -remarks

The 
<b>lineGetAddressID</b> function is used to map a phone number (address) assigned to a line device back to its <i>dwAddressID</i> in the range zero to the number of addresses minus one returned in the line's device capabilities. The 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/tapi/nf-tapi-linemakecall">lineMakeCall</a> function allows the application to make a call by specifying a line handle and an address on the line. The address can be specified as a <i>dwAddressID</i>, as a phone number, or as a device-specific name or identifier. Using a phone number can be practical in environments where a single line is assigned multiple addresses.
