# tapiRequestMakeCall function


## -description

The 
<b>tapiRequestMakeCall</b> function requests the establishment of a voice call. A call-manager application is responsible for establishing the call on behalf of the requesting application, which is then controlled by the user's call-manager application.

## -parameters

### -param lpszDestAddress

Pointer to a memory location where the <b>null</b>-terminated destination address of the call request is located. The address can use the 
[canonical address](/windows/win32/tapi/address-ovr#canonical-addresses) format. Validity of the specified address is not checked by this operation. The maximum length of the address is TAPIMAXDESTADDRESSSIZE characters, which includes the <b>NULL</b> terminator.

### -param lpszAppName

Pointer to a memory location where the <b>null</b>-terminated user-friendly application name of the call request is located. This pointer can be left <b>NULL</b> if the application does not supply an application name. The maximum length of the address is TAPIMAXAPPNAMESIZE characters, which includes the <b>NULL</b> terminator. Longer strings are truncated.

### -param lpszCalledParty

Pointer to a memory location where the <b>null</b>-terminated called party name for the called party of the call is located. This pointer can be left <b>NULL</b> if the application does not wish to supply this information. The maximum length of the string is TAPIMAXCALLEDPARTYSIZE characters, which includes the <b>NULL</b> terminator. Longer strings are truncated.

### -param lpszComment

Pointer to a memory location where the <b>null</b>-terminated comment about the call is located. This pointer can be left <b>NULL</b> if the application does not supply a comment. The maximum length of the address is TAPIMAXCOMMENTSIZE characters, which includes the <b>NULL</b> terminator. Longer strings are truncated.

## -returns

Returns zero if the request succeeds or a negative error number if an error occurs. Possible error return value are:

TAPIERR_NOREQUESTRECIPIENT, TAPIERR_INVALDESTADDRESS, TAPIERR_REQUESTQUEUEFULL, TAPIERR_INVALPOINTER.

## -remarks

A telephony-enabled application can request that a call be placed on its behalf by invoking 
<b>tapiRequestMakeCall</b>, providing only the destination address for the call. This request is forwarded to the user's call-control application, which places the call on behalf of the original application. A default call-control application is provided as part of  Telephony. Users can replace this with a call-control application of their choice.

Invoking 
<b>tapiRequestMakeCall</b> when no call control application is running returns the TAPIERR_NOREQUESTRECIPIENT error indication. If the call control application is not running, TAPI attempts to launch the highest-priority call control application (which is listed for <b>RequestMakeCall</b> in the registry). Invoking this function when the Assisted TAPI request queue is full returns the TAPIERR_REQUESTQUEUEFULL error.
