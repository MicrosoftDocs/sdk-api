## -description
Enables better interoperability with a component that might be handed a Direct3D 11 device, but which wants to leverage Direct3D 12 instead. This interface extends [ID3D11On12Device](nn-d3d11on12-id3d11on12device.md) to retrieve the [Direct3D 12 device](/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nn-d3d12-id3d12device) being interoperated with.

## Inheritance
The **ID3D11On12Device1** interface inherits from the [ID3D11On12Device interface](nn-d3d11on12-id3d11on12device.md).
