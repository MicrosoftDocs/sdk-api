# IF_OPER_STATUS enumeration


## -description


The <b>IF_OPER_STATUS</b> enumeration specifies the operational status of an interface.


## -enum-fields




### -field IfOperStatusUp

The interface is up and operational. The interface is able to pass packets.


### -field IfOperStatusDown

The interface is not down and not operational. The interface is unable to pass packets.


### -field IfOperStatusTesting

The interface is being tested.


### -field IfOperStatusUnknown

The interface status is unknown.


### -field IfOperStatusDormant

The interface is not
   in a condition to pass packets. The interface is  not up, but is
   in a pending state, waiting for some external event.  This state identifies the situation where the
   interface is waiting for events to place it in the up state.


### -field IfOperStatusNotPresent

This state is a refinement on the down state which
   indicates that the interface is down specifically because
   some component (for example, a hardware component) is not present in
   the system.


### -field IfOperStatusLowerLayerDown

This state is a refinement on the down state.
   The interface is operational, but a networking layer below the interface is not operational.


## -remarks



The <b>IF_OPER_STATUS</b> enumeration is used in the <b>OperStatus</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/iptypes/ns-iptypes-ip_adapter_addresses_lh">IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES</a>  structure.
