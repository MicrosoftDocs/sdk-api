# NET_PHYSICAL_LOCATION_LH structure


## -description


The NET_PHYSICAL_LOCATION structure provides NDIS with information about the physical location of a
  registered network interface.


## -struct-fields




### -field BusNumber

The bus number of the physical location for hardware. If the physical location is unknown, set
     this member to NIIF_BUS_NUMBER_UNKNOWN. Other values are reserved for NDIS.


### -field SlotNumber

The slot number of the physical location for hardware. If the physical location is unknown, set
     this member to NIIF_SLOT_NUMBER_UNKNOWN. Other values are reserved for NDIS.


### -field FunctionNumber

The function number of the physical location for hardware. If the physical location is unknown,
     set this member to NIIF_FUNCTION_NUMBER_UNKNOWN. Other values are reserved for NDIS.


## -remarks



A network interface provider initializes a 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/ns-ndis-_net_if_information">NET_IF_INFORMATION</a> structure to provide
    NDIS with information about each registered interface. The NET_PHYSICAL_LOCATION structure is included in
    the 
    <b>PhysicalLocation</b> member of the NET_IF_INFORMATION structure.

NET_PHYSICAL_LOCATION contains information that remains constant during the lifetime of the interface.
    To register an interface, a provider passes a pointer to a provider-initialized NET_IF_INFORMATION
    structure to the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisifregisterinterface">NdisIfRegisterInterface</a> function.
