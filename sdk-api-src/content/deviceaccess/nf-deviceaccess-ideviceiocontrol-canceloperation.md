## -description


The <b>CancelOperation</b> method attempts to cancel a previously issued call by using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/deviceaccess/nf-deviceaccess-ideviceiocontrol-deviceiocontrolasync">DeviceIoControlAsync</a> method.


## -parameters




### -param cancelContext [in]

The cancel context that a previous call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/deviceaccess/nf-deviceaccess-ideviceiocontrol-deviceiocontrolasync">DeviceIoControlAsync</a> returned.


## -returns



This method supports standard return values, in addition to these:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The operation was still outstanding, and cancellation was attempted.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>ERROR_NOT_FOUND</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The operation was no longer outstanding.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
