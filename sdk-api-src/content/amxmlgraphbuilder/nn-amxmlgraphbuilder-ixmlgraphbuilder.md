# IXMLGraphBuilder interface


## -description

The <b>IXMLGraphBuilder</b>  interface is used to persist a DirectShow filter graph using an XML file format.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Support for this interface was removed in Windows 7. New applications should not use this interface.</div>
<div> </div>

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IXMLGraphBuilder</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IXMLGraphBuilder</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -members

The <b>IXMLGraphBuilder</b> interface has these methods.

</table>

## -remarks

 To get a pointer to this interface, call <b>CoCreateInstance</b> with the class identifier CLSID_XMLGraphBuilder.

The recommended way to save and load a filter graph is to use the GraphEdit file format:

<ul>
<li>
<a href="/windows/desktop/DirectShow/saving-a-filter-graph-to-a-graphedit-file">Saving a Filter Graph to a GraphEdit File</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="/windows/desktop/DirectShow/loading-a-graphedit-file-programmatically">Loading a GraphEdit File Programmatically</a>
</li>
</ul>
Generally, you should persist a filter graph only for testing purposes and not for production. There is no consistently reliable way to reload a filter graph from a file, because the user's hardware and software configurations can change between sessions. Therefore, except for testing, an application should always build a filter graph programmatically.
