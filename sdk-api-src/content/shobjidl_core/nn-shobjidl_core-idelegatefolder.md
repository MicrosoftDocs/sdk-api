# IDelegateFolder interface


## -description

Exposes a method through which a delegate folder is given the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-imalloc">IMalloc</a> interface required to allocate and free item IDs.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IDelegateFolder</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IDelegateFolder</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

The IDs allocated by the delegate folder are in the form of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/ns-shobjidl_core-delegateitemid">DELEGATEITEMID</a> structures. It is the delegate's job to pack its data into the pointer to an item identifier list (PIDL) in the <b>DELEGATEITEMID</b> format.
