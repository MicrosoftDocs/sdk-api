# IShellLinkW::SetRelativePath


## -description


Sets the relative path to the Shell link object.


## -parameters




### -param pszPathRel

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

The address of a buffer that contains the fully-qualified path of the shortcut file, relative to which the shortcut resolution should be performed. It should be a file name, not a folder name.


### -param dwReserved

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Reserved. Set this parameter to zero.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



Clients commonly define a relative link when it may be moved along with its target, causing the absolute path to become invalid. The <b>SetRelativePath</b> method can be used to help the link resolution process find its target based on a common path prefix between the target and the relative path. To assist in the resolution process, clients should set the relative path as part of the link creation process.


#### Examples



Consider the following scenario:

<ul>
<li>You have a link: c:\MyLink.lnk.</li>
<li>The link target is c:\MyDocs\MyFile.txt.</li>
<li>You want to move the link and MyDocs\MyFile.txt to d:\.</li>
</ul>
You can assist the resolution process by creating the original link with a relative path before the shortcut is saved.


```cpp
::SetRelativePath("c:\MyLink.lnk", NULL);

```


Before the shortcut is resolved, set a new relative path, and the Resolve code will find the file in its new location.


```cpp
::SetRelativePath("d:\MyLink.lnk", NULL);

```
