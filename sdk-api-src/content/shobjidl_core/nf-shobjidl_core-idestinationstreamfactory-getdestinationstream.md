# IDestinationStreamFactory::GetDestinationStream


## -description


Gets an empty stream that receives the new version of the file being copied.


## -parameters




### -param ppstm [out]

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-istream">IStream</a>**</b>

The address of a pointer to the new stream.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



The property handler author calls <b>IDestinationStreamFactory::GetDestinationStream</b> to get a new empty stream that the new version of the file will write to. The handler builds the destination stream manually, copying from the source stream as necessary.
