# NWMF enumeration


## -description


Flags used by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-inewwindowmanager-evaluatenewwindow">INewWindowManager::EvaluateNewWindow</a>. These values are factors in the decision of whether to display a pop-up window.


## -enum-fields




### -field NWMF_UNLOADING

The page is unloading. This flag is set in response to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/aa741480(v=vs.85)">onbeforeunload</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/aa741488(v=vs.85)">onunload</a> events. Some pages load pop-up windows when you leave them, not when you enter. This flag is used to identify those situations.


### -field NWMF_USERINITED

The call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-inewwindowmanager-evaluatenewwindow">INewWindowManager::EvaluateNewWindow</a> is the result of a user-initiated action (a mouse click or key press). Use this flag in conjunction with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/ne-shobjidl_core-nwmf">NWMF_FIRST_USERINITED</a> flag to determine whether the call is a direct or indirect result of the user-initiated action.


### -field NWMF_FIRST

When <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/ne-shobjidl_core-nwmf">NWMF_USERINITED</a> is present, this flag indicates that the call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-inewwindowmanager-evaluatenewwindow">INewWindowManager::EvaluateNewWindow</a> is the first query that results from this user-initiated action. Always use this flag in conjunction with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/ne-shobjidl_core-nwmf">NWMF_USERINITED</a>.


### -field NWMF_OVERRIDEKEY

The override key (ALT) was pressed. The override key is used to bypass the pop-up manager—allowing all pop-up windows to display—and must be held down at the time that <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-inewwindowmanager-evaluatenewwindow">INewWindowManager::EvaluateNewWindow</a> is called. 
            
                

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  When <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-inewwindowmanager-evaluatenewwindow">INewWindowManager::EvaluateNewWindow</a> is implemented for a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/aa752040(v=vs.85)">WebBrowser</a> control host, the implementer can choose to ignore the override key.</div>
<div> </div>

### -field NWMF_SHOWHELP

The new window attempting to load is the result of a call to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window">showHelp</a> method. Help is sometimes displayed in a separate window, and this flag is valuable in those cases.


### -field NWMF_HTMLDIALOG

The new window is a dialog box that displays HTML content.


### -field NWMF_FROMDIALOGCHILD

The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-inewwindowmanager-evaluatenewwindow">EvaluateNewWindow</a> method is being called from an HTML dialog. The new window should not show the UI in the parent window.


### -field NWMF_USERREQUESTED

The new windows was definitely requested by the user, either by selecting Open in New Window from a context menu or pressing Shift and clicking a link.
            


### -field NWMF_USERALLOWED

The call to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-inewwindowmanager-evaluatenewwindow">EvaluateNewWindow</a> method is the result of the user requesting a replay that resulted in a refresh.
            


### -field NWMF_FORCEWINDOW

The new window should be forced to open in a new window rather than a tab.
            


### -field NWMF_FORCETAB

The new window should be forced to open in a new tab.
            


### -field NWMF_SUGGESTWINDOW

The new window should open in a new tab unless <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/ne-shobjidl_core-nwmf">NWMF_FORCEtab</a> is also present, indicating that user wants the window to open as a window.
            


### -field NWMF_SUGGESTTAB

The new window should open in a new tab unless <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/ne-shobjidl_core-nwmf">NWMF_FORCEWINDOW</a> is also present, indicating that user wants the window to open as a window.
            


### -field NWMF_INACTIVETAB

The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-inewwindowmanager-evaluatenewwindow">EvaluateNewWindow</a> method is being called from an inactive tab.
