# KF_CATEGORY enumeration


## -description

Value that represent a category by which a folder registered with the Known Folder system can be classified.

## -enum-fields

### -field KF_CATEGORY_VIRTUAL

Virtual folders are not part of the file system, which is to say that they have no path. For example, <b>Control Panel</b> and <b>Printers</b> are virtual folders. A number of features such as folder path and redirection do not apply to this category.

### -field KF_CATEGORY_FIXED

Fixed file system folders are not managed by the Shell and are usually given a permanent path when the system is installed. For example, the <b>Windows</b> and <b>Program Files</b> folders are fixed folders. A number of features such as redirection do not apply to this category.

### -field KF_CATEGORY_COMMON

Common folders are those file system folders used for sharing data and settings, accessible by all users of a system. For example, all users share a common <b>Documents</b> folder as well as their per-user <b>Documents</b> folder.

### -field KF_CATEGORY_PERUSER

Per-user folders are those stored under each user's profile and accessible only by that user. For example, <code>%USERPROFILE%\Pictures</code>. This category of folder usually supports many features including aliasing, redirection and customization. 
                
                



<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The user profile root folder (<a href="/windows/desktop/shell/knownfolderid">FOLDERID_Profile</a>) does not support redirection.</div>
<div> </div>

## -remarks

The <b>KF_CATEGORY</b> type is defined in Shobjidl.h as shown here.
