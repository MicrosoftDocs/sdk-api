# IPersistFolder::Initialize


## -description

Instructs a Shell folder object to initialize itself based on the information passed.

## -parameters

### -param pidl

Type: <b>LPCITEMIDLIST</b>

The address of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shtypes/ns-shtypes-itemidlist">ITEMIDLIST</a> (item identifier list) structure that specifies the absolute location of the folder.

## -returns

Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

## -remarks

All objects that implement the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-ishellfolder">IShellFolder</a> interface for use in the Shell's namespace must implement this method. When a folder's location in the namespace is not a relevant consideration, this method can simply return S_OK. When the location is relevant to the folder, you should store the fully qualified IDLIST passed in for later reference.

For example, if the folder implementation needs to construct a fully qualified pointer to an item identifier list (PIDL) to elements that it contains, the PIDL passed to this method should be used to construct the fully qualified PIDLs.
