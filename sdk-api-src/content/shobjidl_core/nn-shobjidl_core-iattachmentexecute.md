# IAttachmentExecute interface


## -description

Exposes methods that work with client applications to present a user environment that provides safe download and exchange of files through email and messaging attachments.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IAttachmentExecute</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IAttachmentExecute</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

This interface assumes the following:
                

<ul>
<li>The client has policies or settings  for attachment support and behavior.</li>
<li>The client interacts with the user.</li>
</ul>
The IID for this interface is <b>IID_IAttachmentExecute</b>.

Here is an example of how an email client might use <b>IAttachmentExecute</b>.



```

// CClientAttachmentInfo, defined by the client, implements all the
// necessary client functionality concerning attachments. 
class CClientAttachmentInfo;  

// Creates an instance of IAttachmentExecute
HRESULT CreateAttachmentServices(IAttachmentExecute **ppae)
