# IUserNotification::PlaySound


## -description


Plays a sound in conjunction with the notification.


## -parameters




### -param pszSoundName [in]

Type: <b>LPCWSTR</b>

A pointer to a null-terminated Unicode string that specifies the alias of the sound file to play.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



The string pointed to by <i>pszSoundNamepqc</i> contains an alias for a system event found in the registry or the Win.ini file; for instance, "SystemExit".

The specified sound is played asynchronously and the method returns immediately after beginning the sound. To stop an asynchronous waveform sound, call <b>IUserNotification::PlaySound</b> with <i>pszSoundNamepqc</i> set to <b>NULL</b>.

The specified sound event will yield to another sound event that is already playing. If a sound cannot be played because the resource needed to play that sound is busy, the method immediately returns S_FALSE without playing the requested sound.

If the specified sound cannot be found, <b>IUserNotification::PlaySound</b> uses the system default sound.
