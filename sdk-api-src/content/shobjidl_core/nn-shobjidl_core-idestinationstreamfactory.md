# IDestinationStreamFactory interface


## -description


Exposes a method for manually copying a stream or file before applying changes to properties.


## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IDestinationStreamFactory</b> interface inherits from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IDestinationStreamFactory</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -members

The <b>IDestinationStreamFactory</b> interface has these methods.
<table class="members" id="memberListMethods">
<tr>
<th align="left" width="37%">Method</th>
<th align="left" width="63%">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr data="declared;">
<td align="left" width="37%">
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-idestinationstreamfactory-getdestinationstream">GetDestinationStream</a>
</td>
<td align="left" width="63%">
Gets an empty stream that receives the new version of the file being copied.

</td>
</tr>
</table> 


## -remarks



The default copy-on-write behavior provided by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/propsys/nn-propsys-ipropertystore">IPropertyStore</a> causes the entire source stream to be duplicated during a write operation. This can be costly for large streams, especially when a large portion of the stream is to be changed. <b>IDestinationStreamFactory</b> provides an alternative for the property handler author, who can use it manually to ensure that property changes do not corrupt the stream in case of failure. To do this, the author marks the handler as NoTransactedMode in the handler's CoClass registry key, and queries the stream for this interface.
