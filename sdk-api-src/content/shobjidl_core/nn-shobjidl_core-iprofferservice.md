The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IProfferService</b> interface inherits from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IProfferService</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -members

The <b>IProfferService</b> interface has these methods.
<table class="members" id="memberListMethods">

<tr data="declared;">

<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-iprofferservice-revokeservice">RevokeService</a>
</td>
<td align="left" width="63%">
Makes a service unavailable that had previously been available to other objects through <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-iprofferservice-profferservice">IProfferService::ProfferService</a>.
		

</td>
</tr>
</table> 


## -remarks



Objects that expose a service first call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-queryinterface(q)">QueryInterface</a> on their host for this interface, then execute <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-iprofferservice-profferservice">IProfferService::ProfferService</a>.
