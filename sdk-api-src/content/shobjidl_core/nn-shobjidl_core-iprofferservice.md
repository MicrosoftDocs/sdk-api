# IProfferService interface


## -description

Exposes a general mechanism for objects to offer services to other objects on the same host.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IProfferService</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IProfferService</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

Objects that expose a service first call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-queryinterface(q)">QueryInterface</a> on their host for this interface, then execute <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-iprofferservice-profferservice">IProfferService::ProfferService</a>.
