# ICommDlgBrowser interface


## -description

Exposed by the common file dialog boxes to be used when they host a Shell browser. If supported, <b>ICommDlgBrowser</b> exposes methods that allow a Shell view to handle several cases that require different behavior in a dialog box than in a normal Shell view. You obtain an <b>ICommDlgBrowser</b> interface pointer by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-queryinterface(q)">QueryInterface</a> on the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-ishellbrowser">IShellBrowser</a> object.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">ICommDlgBrowser</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>ICommDlgBrowser</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  In Windows XP and earlier, this interface was defined in Shlobj.h.
      </div>
<div> </div>
This interface is implemented only by the common file dialog boxes.

Use <b>ICommDlgBrowser</b> when you need to provide special behavior while hosted inside the common dialog boxes.
