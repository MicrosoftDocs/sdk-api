# IAttachmentExecute::Execute


## -description


Executes an action on an attachment.


## -parameters




### -param hwnd [in]

Type: <b>HWND</b>

The handle of the parent window.


### -param pszVerb [in, optional]

Type: <b>LPCWSTR</b>

A pointer to a null-terminated string that contains a verb specifying the action to be performed on the file. See the <i>lpOperation</i> parameter in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-shellexecutea">ShellExecute</a> for valid strings. This value can be <b>NULL</b>.


### -param phProcess [out, optional]

Type: <b>HANDLE*</b>

A pointer to a handle to the source process, used for synchronous operation. This value can be <b>NULL</b>.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



Before calling <b>IAttachmentExecute::Execute</b>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-iattachmentexecute-setlocalpath">IAttachmentExecute::SetLocalPath</a> must be called with a valid local path and the file must be copied to that location.

If a prompt is indicated, <b>IAttachmentExecute::Execute</b> calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-iattachmentexecute-prompt">IAttachmentExecute::Prompt</a> using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/ne-shobjidl_core-attachment_action">ATTACHMENT_ACTION_EXEC</a> value.

<b>IAttachmentExecute::Execute</b> may run virus scanners or other trust services to validate the file before executing it. Note that these services can delete or alter the file.

<b>IAttachmentExecute::Execute</b> may attach <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-iattachmentexecute-checkpolicy">evidence</a> to the local path in its NTFS alternate data stream (ADS).

If <i>phProcess</i> is not <b>NULL</b>, <b>IAttachmentExecute::Execute</b> operates as a synchronous process and returns an <b>HPROCESS</b>, if available. If <i>phProcess</i> is <b>NULL</b>, <b>IAttachmentExecute::Execute</b> operates as an asynchronous process. This implies that the calling application has a message pump and a long-lived window.

If the handle pointed to by <i>phProcess</i> is non-<b>NULL</b> when the method returns, the calling application is responsible for calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle">CloseHandle</a> to free the handle when it is no longer needed.
