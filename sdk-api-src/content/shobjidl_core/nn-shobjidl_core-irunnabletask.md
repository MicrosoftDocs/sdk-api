# IRunnableTask interface


## -description

A free-threaded interface that can be exposed by an object to allow operations to be performed on a background thread. For example, if the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-iextractimage-getlocation">IExtractImage::GetLocation</a> method returns E_PENDING, the calling application is permitted to extract the image on a background thread.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IRunnableTask</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IRunnableTask</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

Implement <b>IRunnableTask</b> if your namespace extension is free-threaded, and you want to allow a task such as icon extraction to be managed by a scheduler. Only the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-irunnabletask-run">Run</a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-irunnabletask-isrunning">IsRunning</a> methods must be implemented. If you do not want to implement <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-irunnabletask-kill">Kill</a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-irunnabletask-resume">Resume</a>, and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-irunnabletask-suspend">Suspend</a>, simply have them return E_NOTIMPL.

If you are using <b>IRunnableTask</b> to extract an image on a background thread, that is, if the object exposes <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-iextractimage">IExtractImage</a>, then <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-irunnabletask-run">Run</a> is not necessary, as the system will use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-iextractimage-extract">IExtractImage::Extract</a> to manage the task. The other methods (<a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-irunnabletask-kill">Kill</a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-irunnabletask-resume">Resume</a>, and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-irunnabletask-suspend">Suspend</a>) are optional in this case, but will be used by the system if they are implemented.

You do not call this interface directly. <b>IRunnableTask</b> is used by the operating system only when it has confirmed that your application is aware of this interface.

<b>IRunnableTask</b> implements <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> as well as the five listed methods.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  <b>Windows Vista and later.</b> Prior to Windows Vista this interface was declared in Shlobj.h.</div>
