## -description


Gets a value that states whether any file operations initiated by a call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-ifileoperation-performoperations">IFileOperation::PerformOperations</a> were stopped before they were complete. The operations could be stopped either by user action or silently by the system.


## -parameters




### -param pfAnyOperationsAborted [out]

Type: <b>BOOL*</b>

When this method returns, points to <b>TRUE</b> if any file operations were aborted before they were complete; otherwise, <b>FALSE</b>.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



Call this method after <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-ifileoperation-performoperations">IFileOperation::PerformOperations</a> returns.

You should call <b>IFileOperation::GetAnyOperationsAborted</b> regardless of whether <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-ifileoperation-performoperations">IFileOperation::PerformOperations</a> returned a success or failure code. A success code can be returned even if the operation was stopped by the user or the system.

This method provides the same functionality as the <b>fAnyOperationsAborted</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shellapi/ns-shellapi-shfileopstructa">SHFILEOPSTRUCT</a> structure used by the legacy function <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-shfileoperationa">SHFileOperation</a>.
