# _KF_DEFINITION_FLAGS enumeration


## -description

Flags that specify certain known folder behaviors. Used with the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/ns-shobjidl_core-knownfolder_definition">KNOWNFOLDER_DEFINITION</a> structure.

## -enum-fields

### -field KFDF_LOCAL_REDIRECT_ONLY

Prevent a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/ne-shobjidl_core-kf_category">per-user</a> known folder from being redirected to a network location. Note that if the known folder has been flagged with KFDF_LOCAL_REDIRECT_ONLY but it is a subfolder of a known folder that is redirected to a network location, this subfolder is redirected also.

### -field KFDF_ROAMABLE

Can be roamed through a PC-to-PC synchronization.

### -field KFDF_PRECREATE

Create the folder when the user first logs on. Normally a known folder is not created until it is first called. At that time, an API such as <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-shcreateiteminknownfolder">SHCreateItemInKnownFolder</a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-iknownfolder-getshellitem">IKnownFolder::GetShellItem</a> is called with the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shlobj_core/ne-shlobj_core-known_folder_flag">KF_FLAG_CREATE</a> flag. However, some known folders need to exist immediately. An example is those known folders under %USERPROFILE%, which must exist to provide a proper view. In those cases, KFDF_PRECREATE is set and Windows Explorer calls the creation API during its user initialization.

### -field KFDF_STREAM

<b>Introduced in Windows 7</b>. The known folder is a file rather than a folder.

### -field KFDF_PUBLISHEXPANDEDPATH

<b>Introduced in Windows 7</b>. The full path of the known folder, with any environment variables fully expanded, is stored in the registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER.

### -field KFDF_NO_REDIRECT_UI

<b>Introduced in Windows 8.1</b>. Prevent showing the <b>Locations</b> tab in the property dialog of the known folder. 

<b>Introduced in Windows 8.1</b>. Prevent showing the <b>Locations</b> tab in the property dialog of the known folder.

## -remarks

The <b>KF_DEFINITION_FLAGS</b> type is defined in Shobjidl.h as shown here.


```
typedef DWORD KF_DEFINITION_FLAGS;
```
