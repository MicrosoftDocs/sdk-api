# IFileOperation::PerformOperations


## -description


Executes all selected operations.


## -parameters






## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

Returns S_OK if successful, or an error value otherwise. Note that if the operation was canceled by the user, this method can still return a success code. Use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-ifileoperation-getanyoperationsaborted">GetAnyOperationsAborted</a> method to determine if this was the case.




## -remarks



This method is called last to execute those actions that have been specified earlier by calling their individual methods. For instance, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-ifileoperation-renameitem">RenameItem</a> does not rename the item, it simply sets the parameters. The actual renaming is done when you call <b>PerformOperations</b>.
