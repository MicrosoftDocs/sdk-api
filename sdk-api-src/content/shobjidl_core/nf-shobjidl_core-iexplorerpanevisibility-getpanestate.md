### -param peps [out]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/shobjidl_core/ne-shobjidl_core-_explorerpanestate">EXPLORERPANESTATE</a>*</b>

When this method returns, contains the visibility state of the given Windows Explorer pane as one of the <a href="/windows/win32/api/shobjidl_core/ne-shobjidl_core-_explorerpanestate">EXPLORERPANESTATE</a> constants.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



If the implementer does not care about the state of a given pane and therefore does not want to change it, then the implementer should return a success code for the method and EPS_DONTCARE for the <i>peps</i> parameter. If the method fails, it is treated as if EPS_DONTCARE was returned for the <i>peps</i> parameter.
