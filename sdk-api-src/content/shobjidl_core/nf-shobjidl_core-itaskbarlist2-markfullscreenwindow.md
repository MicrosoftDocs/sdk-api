# ITaskbarList2::MarkFullscreenWindow


## -description

Marks a window as full-screen.

## -parameters

### -param hwnd [in]

Type: <b>HWND</b>

The handle of the window to be marked.

### -param fFullscreen [in]

Type: <b>BOOL</b>

A Boolean value marking the desired full-screen status of the window.

## -returns

Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

## -remarks

Setting the value of <i>fFullscreen</i> to <b>TRUE</b>, the Shell treats this window as a full-screen window, and the taskbar is moved to the bottom of the z-order when this window is active. Setting the value of <i>fFullscreen</i> to <b>FALSE</b> removes the full-screen marking, but <i>does not</i> cause the Shell to treat the window as though it were definitely not full-screen. With a <b>FALSE</b> <i>fFullscreen</i> value, the Shell depends on its automatic detection facility to specify how the window should be treated, possibly still flagging the window as full-screen.



**Since Windows 7,** call `SetProp(hwnd, L”NonRudeHWND”, reinterpret_cast<HANDLE>(TRUE))` before showing a window to indicate to the Shell that the window should not be treated as full-screen. This ensures the taskbar does not adjust itself to be below the window in z-order. This is similar to `ITaskbarList2::MarkFullscreenWindow(FALSE)` except the Shell will not fallback to its automatic detection facility and will not treat the window as full-screen.
