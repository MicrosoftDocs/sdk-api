# IFileOpenDialog::GetSelectedItems


## -description

Gets the currently selected items in the dialog. These items may be items selected in the view, or text selected in the file name edit box.

## -parameters

### -param ppsai [out]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-ishellitemarray">IShellItemArray</a>**</b>

The address of a pointer to an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-ishellitemarray">IShellItemArray</a> through which the selected items can be accessed.

## -returns

Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

## -remarks

This method can be used for single item or multiple item selections. If the user has entered new text in the file name field, this can be a time-consuming operation. When the application calls this method, the application parses the text in the <code>filename</code> field. For example, if this is a network share, the operation could take some time. However, this operation will not block the UI, since the user should able to stop the operation, which will result in <b>IFileOpenDialog::GetSelectedItems</b> returning a failure code).
