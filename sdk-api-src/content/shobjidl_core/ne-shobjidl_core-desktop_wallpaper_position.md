# DESKTOP_WALLPAPER_POSITION enumeration


## -description

Specifies how the desktop wallpaper should be displayed.

## -enum-fields

### -field DWPOS_CENTER

Center the image; do not stretch. This is equivalent to the <a href="/windows/desktop/shell/iactivedesktop-flags">WPSTYLE_CENTER</a> style in <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shlobj_core/nn-shlobj_core-iactivedesktop">IActiveDesktop</a>.

### -field DWPOS_TILE

Tile the image across all monitors. This is equivalent to the <a href="/windows/desktop/shell/iactivedesktop-flags">WPSTYLE_TILE</a> style in <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shlobj_core/nn-shlobj_core-iactivedesktop">IActiveDesktop</a>.

### -field DWPOS_STRETCH

Stretch the image to exactly fit on the monitor. This is equivalent to the <a href="/windows/desktop/shell/iactivedesktop-flags">WPSTYLE_STRETCH</a> style in <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shlobj_core/nn-shlobj_core-iactivedesktop">IActiveDesktop</a>.

### -field DWPOS_FIT

Stretch the image to exactly the height or width of the monitor without changing its aspect ratio or cropping the image. This can result in <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-idesktopwallpaper-getbackgroundcolor">colored letterbox bars</a> on either side or on above and below of the image. This is equivalent to the <a href="/windows/desktop/shell/iactivedesktop-flags">WPSTYLE_KEEPASPECT</a> style in <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shlobj_core/nn-shlobj_core-iactivedesktop">IActiveDesktop</a>.

### -field DWPOS_FILL

Stretch the image to fill the screen, cropping the image as necessary to avoid letterbox bars. This is equivalent to the <a href="/windows/desktop/shell/iactivedesktop-flags">WPSTYLE_CROPTOFIT</a> style in <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shlobj_core/nn-shlobj_core-iactivedesktop">IActiveDesktop</a>.
