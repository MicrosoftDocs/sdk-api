# IFileDialogEvents::OnShareViolation


## -description


Enables an application to respond to sharing violations that arise from Open or Save operations.


## -parameters




### -param pfd [in]

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-ifiledialog">IFileDialog</a>*</b>

A pointer to the interface that represents the dialog.


### -param psi [in]

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-ishellitem">IShellItem</a>*</b>

A pointer to the interface that represents the item that has the sharing violation.


### -param pResponse [out]

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/ne-shobjidl_core-fde_shareviolation_response">FDE_SHAREVIOLATION_RESPONSE</a>*</b>

A pointer to a value from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/ne-shobjidl_core-fde_shareviolation_response">FDE_SHAREVIOLATION_RESPONSE</a> enumeration indicating the response to the sharing violation.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

The implementer should return E_NOTIMPL if this method is not implemented; S_OK or an appropriate error code otherwise.




## -remarks



The <b>FOS_SHAREAWARE</b> flag must be set through <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-ifiledialog-setoptions">IFileDialog::SetOptions</a> before this method is called.

A sharing violation could possibly arise when the application attempts to open a file, because the file could have been locked between the time that the dialog tested it and the application opened it.
