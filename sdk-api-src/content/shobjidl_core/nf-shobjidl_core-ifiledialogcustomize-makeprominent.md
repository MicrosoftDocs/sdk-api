# IFileDialogCustomize::MakeProminent


## -description


Places a control in the dialog so that it stands out compared to other added controls.


## -parameters




### -param dwIDCtl [in]

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The ID of the control.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



This method causes the control to be placed near the <b>Open</b> or <b>Save</b> button instead of being grouped with the rest of the custom controls.

Only check buttons (check boxes), push buttons, combo boxes, and menus—or a visual group that contains only a single item of one of those types—can be made prominent.

Only one control can be marked in this way. If a dialog has only one added control, that control is marked as prominent by default.
