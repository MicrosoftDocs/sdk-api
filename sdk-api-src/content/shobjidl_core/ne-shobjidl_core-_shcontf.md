# _SHCONTF enumeration


## -description


Determines the types of items included in an enumeration. These values are used with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-ishellfolder-enumobjects">IShellFolder::EnumObjects</a> method.


## -enum-fields




### -field SHCONTF_CHECKING_FOR_CHILDREN

0x00010. <b>Windows 7 and later</b>. The calling application is checking for the existence of child items in the folder.


### -field SHCONTF_FOLDERS

0x00020. Include items that are folders in the enumeration.


### -field SHCONTF_NONFOLDERS

0x00040. Include items that are not folders in the enumeration.


### -field SHCONTF_INCLUDEHIDDEN

0x00080. Include hidden items in the enumeration. This does not include hidden system items. (To include hidden system items, use SHCONTF_INCLUDESUPERHIDDEN.)


### -field SHCONTF_INIT_ON_FIRST_NEXT

0x00100. No longer used; always assumed. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-ishellfolder-enumobjects">IShellFolder::EnumObjects</a> can return without validating the enumeration object. Validation can be postponed until the first call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-ienumidlist-next">IEnumIDList::Next</a>. Use this flag when a user interface might be displayed prior to the first <b>IEnumIDList::Next</b> call. For a user interface to be presented, <i>hwnd</i> must be set to a valid window handle.


### -field SHCONTF_NETPRINTERSRCH

0x00200. The calling application is looking for printer objects.


### -field SHCONTF_SHAREABLE

0x00400. The calling application is looking for resources that can be shared.


### -field SHCONTF_STORAGE

0x00800. Include items with accessible storage and their ancestors, including hidden items.


### -field SHCONTF_NAVIGATION_ENUM

0x01000. <b>Windows 7 and later</b>. Child folders should provide a navigation enumeration.


### -field SHCONTF_FASTITEMS

0x02000. <b>Windows Vista and later</b>. The calling application is looking for resources that can be enumerated quickly.


### -field SHCONTF_FLATLIST

0x04000. <b>Windows Vista and later</b>. Enumerate items as a simple list even if the folder itself is not structured in that way.


### -field SHCONTF_ENABLE_ASYNC

0x08000. <b>Windows Vista and later</b>. The calling application is monitoring for change notifications. This means that the enumerator does not have to return all results. Items can be reported through change notifications.


### -field SHCONTF_INCLUDESUPERHIDDEN

0x10000. <b>Windows 7 and later</b>. Include hidden system items in the enumeration. This value does not include hidden non-system items. (To include hidden non-system items, use SHCONTF_INCLUDEHIDDEN.)


## -remarks



By setting the <b><b>SHCONTF_INIT_ON_FIRST_NEXT</b></b> flag, the calling application suggests that the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-ishellfolder-enumobjects">IShellFolder::EnumObjects</a> method can expedite the enumeration process by returning an uninitialized enumeration object. Initialization can be deferred until the enumeration process starts. If initializing the enumeration object is a lengthy process, the method implementation should immediately return an uninitialized object. Defer initialization until the first time the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-ienumidlist-next">IEnumIDList::Next</a> method is called. If initialization requires user input, the method implementation should use <i>hwnd</i> as the parent window for the user interface. For an explanation of what to do when <i>hwnd</i> is set to <b>NULL</b>, see the <b>IShellFolder::EnumObjects</b> reference.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The name of this enumeration was changed to <b>SHCONTF</b> in Windows Vista. Earlier, it was named <b>SHCONTF</b>. The name <b>SHCONTF</b> is still defined through a typedef statement, however, so it can continue to be used by legacy code.</div>
