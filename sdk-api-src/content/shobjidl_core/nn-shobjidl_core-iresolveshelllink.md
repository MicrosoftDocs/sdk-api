# IResolveShellLink interface


## -description

Exposes a method that enables an application to request that a Shell folder object resolve a link for one of its items.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IResolveShellLink</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IResolveShellLink</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -members

The <b>IResolveShellLink</b> interface has these methods.

</tr>
</table>

## -remarks

Namespace extensions implement this object to support link resolution.

This interface is not typically used by applications.

With <a href="/windows/desktop/shell/nse-works">namespace extensions</a>, shortcut objects (.lnk files) implement the essential functionality of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-ishelllinka-resolve">IShellLink::Resolve</a> by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-iresolveshelllink-resolveshelllink">IResolveShellLink::ResolveShellLink</a>. <b>IResolveShellLink</b> is exported by a link resolution object that is created on request by the Shell folder.

To retrieve a pointer to a link resolution object's <b>IResolveShellLink</b> interface:
				

<ul>
<li>For an object that is contained by a folder, call the folder's <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-ishellfolder-getuiobjectof">IShellFolder::GetUIObjectOf</a> method and request an <b>IResolveShellLink</b> pointer (IID_IResolveShellLink).</li>
<li>For the folder object itself, call the folder's <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-ishellfolder-createviewobject">IShellFolder::CreateViewObject</a> method and request an <b>IResolveShellLink</b> pointer (IID_IResolveShellLink).</li>
</ul>
