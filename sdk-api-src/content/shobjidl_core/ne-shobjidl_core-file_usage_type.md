# FILE_USAGE_TYPE enumeration


## -description


Constants used by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-ifileisinuse-getusage">IFileIsInUse::GetUsage</a> to indicate how a file in use is being used.


## -enum-fields




### -field FUT_PLAYING

The file is being played by the process that has it open.


### -field FUT_EDITING

The file is being edited by the process that has it open.


### -field FUT_GENERIC

The file is open in the process for an unspecified action or an action that does not readily fit into the other two categories.


## -remarks



The interpretation of "playing" or "editing" is left to the application's implementation of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-ifileisinuse">IFileIsInUse</a>. Generally, "playing" would refer to a media file while "editing" can refer to any file being altered in an application. However, the application itself best knows how to map these terms to its actions.
