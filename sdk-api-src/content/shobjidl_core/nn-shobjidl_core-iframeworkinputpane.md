# IFrameworkInputPane interface


## -description

Provides methods that enable apps to be informed of state changes and location for the input pane. The input pane is a UI element, an on-screen keyboard or handwriting panel, that appears when the user performs an action that requires them to enter information, such as selecting a search box or an entry field in a form. Apps can then adjust their UI so that the input pane does not obscure items that the user might need to access while the input pane is shown.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IFrameworkInputPane</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IFrameworkInputPane</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

<h3><a id="When_to_implement"></a><a id="when_to_implement"></a><a id="WHEN_TO_IMPLEMENT"></a>When to implement</h3>
Do not implement this interface; the implementation is supplied with Windows as CLSID_FrameworkInputPane.
