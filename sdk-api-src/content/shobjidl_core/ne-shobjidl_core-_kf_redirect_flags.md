# _KF_REDIRECT_FLAGS enumeration


## -description


Flags used by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-iknownfoldermanager-redirect">IKnownFolderManager::Redirect</a> to specify details of a known folder redirection such as permissions and ownership for the redirected folder.


## -enum-fields




### -field KF_REDIRECT_USER_EXCLUSIVE

Ensure that only the user has permission to access the redirected folder.


### -field KF_REDIRECT_COPY_SOURCE_DACL

Copy the DACL of the source folder to the target to maintain current access permissions.


### -field KF_REDIRECT_OWNER_USER

Sets the user as the owner of a newly created target folder unless the user is a member of the Administrator group, in which case Administrator is set as the owner. Must be called with KF_REDIRECT_SET_OWNER_EXPLICIT.


### -field KF_REDIRECT_SET_OWNER_EXPLICIT

Set the owner of a newly created target folder.  If the user belongs to the Administrators group, Administrators is assigned as the owner. Must be called with KF_REDIRECT_OWNER_USER.


### -field KF_REDIRECT_CHECK_ONLY

Do not perform a redirection, simply check whether redirection has occurred. If so, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-iknownfoldermanager-redirect">IKnownFolderManager::Redirect</a> returns S_OK; if not, or if some actions remain to be completed, it returns S_FALSE.


### -field KF_REDIRECT_WITH_UI

Display UI during the redirection.


### -field KF_REDIRECT_UNPIN

Unpin the source folder.


### -field KF_REDIRECT_PIN

Pin the target folder.


### -field KF_REDIRECT_COPY_CONTENTS

Copy the existing contents—both files and subfolders—of the known folder to the redirected folder.


### -field KF_REDIRECT_DEL_SOURCE_CONTENTS

Delete the contents of the source folder after they have been copied to the redirected folder. This flag is valid only if <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/shobjidl_core/ne-shobjidl_core-_kf_redirect_flags">KF_REDIRECT_COPY_CONTENTS</a> is set.


### -field KF_REDIRECT_EXCLUDE_ALL_KNOWN_SUBFOLDERS

Reserved. Do not use.


## -remarks



The <b><b>KF_REDIRECT_OWNER_USER</b></b> and <b><b>KF_REDIRECT_SET_OWNER_EXPLICIT</b></b> flags provide ownership checks for the target folder, if that folder exists. By default, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-iknownfoldermanager-redirect">IKnownFolderManager::Redirect</a> does not perform ownership checks. KF_REDIRECT_OWNER_USER and KF_REDIRECT_SET_OWNER_EXPLICIT are only valid if called together.

The <b>KF_REDIRECT_FLAGS</b> type is defined in Shobjidl.h as shown here.


```
typedef DWORD KF_REDIRECT_FLAGS;
```
