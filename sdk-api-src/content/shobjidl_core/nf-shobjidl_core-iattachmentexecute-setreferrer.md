# IAttachmentExecute::SetReferrer


## -description

Sets the security zone associated with the attachment file based on the referring file.

## -parameters

### -param pszReferrer [in]

Type: <b>LPCWSTR</b>

A pointer to a string containing the path of the referring file.

## -returns

Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

## -remarks

<b>IAttachmentExecute::SetReferrer</b> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-iattachmentexecute-setsource">IAttachmentExecute::SetSource</a> have similar functionality. If both are set, the least-trusted zone of the two is used.

<b>IAttachmentExecute::SetReferrer</b> is used by container files to indicate indirect inheritance and avoid zone elevation. It can also be used with shortcut files to limit elevation based on parameters.

Calling <b>IAttachmentExecute::SetReferrer</b> is optional.

<b>IAttachmentExecute::SetReferrer</b> is only used to determine the security zone and its associated policies.
