# IExecuteCommand interface


## -description

Exposes methods that set a given state or parameter related to the command verb, as well as a method to invoke that verb.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IExecuteCommand</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IExecuteCommand</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

<h3><a id="When_to_Implement"></a><a id="when_to_implement"></a><a id="WHEN_TO_IMPLEMENT"></a>When to Implement</h3>
Implement this interface when you choose it as your method to invoke the verb to perform an action on selected items. The items are passed as a Shell item array through <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-iobjectwithselection-setselection">IObjectWithSelection::SetSelection</a>, so the object must also implement <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-iobjectwithselection">IObjectWithSelection</a>.

<h3><a id="When_to_Use"></a><a id="when_to_use"></a><a id="WHEN_TO_USE"></a>When to Use</h3>
Do not call the methods of <b>IExecuteCommand</b> directly. Windows Explorer calls your <b>IExecuteCommand</b> methods when the user wants to perform an action on the items.

Note that, apart from <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-iexecutecommand-execute">Execute</a>, the methods of this interface pass system information to the handler. The system itself calls these methods, setting the parameters appropriately based on system settings and conditions.
