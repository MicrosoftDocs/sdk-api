# SERVICE_ADDRESS structure


## -description


The 
<b>SERVICE_ADDRESS</b> structure contains address information for a service. The structure can accommodate many types of interprocess communications (IPC) mechanisms and their address forms, including remote procedure calls (RPC), named pipes, and sockets.


## -struct-fields




### -field dwAddressType

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The address family to which the socket address pointed to by <b>lpAddress</b> member belongs.


### -field dwAddressFlags

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

A set of bit flags that specify properties of the address. The following bit flags are defined.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="SERVICE_ADDRESS_FLAG_RPC_CN"></a><a id="service_address_flag_rpc_cn"></a><dl>
<dt><b>SERVICE_ADDRESS_FLAG_RPC_CN</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
If this bit flag is set, the service supports connection-oriented RPC over this transport protocol.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="SERVICE_ADDRESS_FLAG_RPC_DG"></a><a id="service_address_flag_rpc_dg"></a><dl>
<dt><b>SERVICE_ADDRESS_FLAG_RPC_DG</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
If this bit flag is set, the service supports datagram-oriented RPC over this transport protocol.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="SERVICE_ADDRESS_FLAG_RPC_NB"></a><a id="service_address_flag_rpc_nb"></a><dl>
<dt><b>SERVICE_ADDRESS_FLAG_RPC_NB</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
If this bit flag is set, the service supports NetBIOS RPC over this transport protocol.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field dwAddressLength

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The size, in bytes, of the address.


### -field dwPrincipalLength

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Reserved for future use. Must be zero.


### -field lpAddress.size_is

 


### -field lpAddress.size_is.dwAddressLength

 


### -field lpAddress

Type: <b>BYTE*</b>

A pointer to a socket address of the appropriate type.


### -field lpPrincipal.size_is

 


### -field lpPrincipal.size_is.dwPrincipalLength

 


### -field lpPrincipal

Type: <b>BYTE*</b>

Reserved for future use. Must be <b>NULL</b>.
