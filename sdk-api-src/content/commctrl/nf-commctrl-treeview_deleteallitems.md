# TreeView_DeleteAllItems macro


## -description

Deletes all items from a tree-view control.

## -parameters

### -param hwnd

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">HWND</a></b>

Handle to the tree-view control.

## -remarks

Once an item is deleted from a tree-view control, its <b>HTREEITEM</b> handle is invalid and cannot be used.

The parent window receives a <a href="/windows/desktop/Controls/tvn-deleteitem">TVN_DELETEITEM</a> notification code when each item is removed.

If the item label is being edited, the edit operation is canceled and the parent window receives the <a href="/windows/desktop/Controls/tvn-endlabeledit">TVN_ENDLABELEDIT</a> notification code. 

You can also delete all items with the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/commctrl/nf-commctrl-treeview_deleteitem">TreeView_DeleteItem</a> macro or the <a href="/windows/desktop/Controls/tvm-deleteitem">TVM_DELETEITEM</a> message by setting 
				<i>lParam</i> to TVI_ROOT.

If the window style for a tree-view control contains TVS_NOSCROLL and all items are deleted, new items are not displayed until the window styles are reset. The following code shows one way to ensure that items are always displayed.



```
DWORD styles = GetWindowLong(hwnd, GWL_STYLE);
TreeView_DeleteAllItems(hwnd);
SetWindowLong(hwnd, GWL_STYLE, styles);
```
