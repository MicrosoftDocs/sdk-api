# Edit_TakeFocus macro


## -description

<p class="CCE_Message">[Intended for internal use; not recommended for use in applications. This macro may not be supported in future versions of Windows.]

Forces a single-line edit control to receive keyboard focus. You can use this macro or send the <a href="/windows/desktop/Controls/em-takefocus">EM_TAKEFOCUS</a> message explicitly.

## -parameters

### -param hwndCtl

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">HWND</a></b>

A handle to the edit control.

## -remarks

The <a href="/windows/desktop/Controls/em-takefocus">EM_TAKEFOCUS</a> message is ignored if the edit control is not a single-line edit control.

If the edit control previously received an <a href="/windows/desktop/Controls/em-nosetfocus">EM_NOSETFOCUS</a> message, the edit control will appear to have the focus without actually having it; otherwise, the edit control will receive focus.
