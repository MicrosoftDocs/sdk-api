# TreeView_DeleteItem macro


## -description

Removes an item and all its children from a tree-view control. You can also send the <a href="/windows/desktop/Controls/tvm-deleteitem">TVM_DELETEITEM</a> message explicitly.

## -parameters

### -param hwnd

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">HWND</a></b>

Handle to the tree-view control.

### -param hitem

Type: <b>HTREEITEM</b>

<b>HTREEITEM</b> handle to the item to delete. If <i>hitem</i> is set to TVI_ROOT, all items are deleted from the tree-view control. You can also use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/commctrl/nf-commctrl-treeview_deleteallitems">TreeView_DeleteAllItems</a> macro to delete all items.

## -remarks

It is not safe to delete items in response to a notification such as <a href="/windows/desktop/Controls/tvn-selchanging">TVN_SELCHANGING</a>.

Once an item is deleted, its handle is invalid and cannot be used.

The parent window receives a <a href="/windows/desktop/Controls/tvn-deleteitem">TVN_DELETEITEM</a> notification code when each item is removed. 

If the item label is being edited, the edit operation is canceled and the parent window receives the <a href="/windows/desktop/Controls/tvn-endlabeledit">TVN_ENDLABELEDIT</a> notification code. 

If you delete all items in a tree-view control that has the <a href="/windows/desktop/Controls/tree-view-control-window-styles">TVS_NOSCROLL</a> style, items subsequently added may not display properly. For more information, see <a href="/windows/desktop/api/commctrl/nf-commctrl-treeview_deleteallitems">TreeView_DeleteAllItems</a>.
