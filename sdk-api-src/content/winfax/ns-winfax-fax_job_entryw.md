# FAX_JOB_ENTRYW structure


## -description

The <b>FAX_JOB_ENTRY</b> structure describes one fax job. The structure includes data on the job type and status, recipient and sender identification, scheduling and delivery settings, and the page count. The <b>SizeOfStruct</b> and <b>RecipientNumber</b> members are required.

## -struct-fields

### -field SizeOfStruct

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the <b>FAX_JOB_ENTRY</b> structure. The calling application must set this member to <b>sizeof(FAX_JOB_ENTRY)</b> before it calls the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/winfax/nf-winfax-faxsetjoba">FaxSetJob</a> function.

### -field JobId

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Specifies a unique number that identifies the fax job of interest. This number must match the value the calling application passes in the JobId parameter to the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/winfax/nf-winfax-faxsetjoba">FaxSetJob</a> function.

### -field UserName

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string that specifies the name of the user who submitted the fax job.

### -field JobType

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Specifies a <b>DWORD</b> variable that specifies the type of the fax job of interest. This member can be one of the following job types.



#### JT_SEND

The job is an outgoing fax transmission.



#### JT_RECEIVE

The job is an incoming fax transmission.



#### JT_UNKNOWN

The job type is unknown. This value indicates that the fax server has not yet scheduled the job.



#### JT_ROUTING

The fax server tried to route the fax transmission, but routing failed. The fax server will attempt to route the job again.



#### JT_FAIL_RECEIVE

The fax server did not route the fax because it did not receive the entire transmission. The fax server saves the partial transmission in a temporary directory.

### -field QueueStatus

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Specifies a <b>DWORD</b> variable that is a set of bit flags indicating the queue status of the fax job identified by the <b>JobId</b> member. This member can be one or more of the following values.



#### JS_PENDING

The fax job is in the queue and pending service.



#### JS_INPROGRESS

The fax job is in progress.



#### JS_DELETING

The fax server is deleting the fax job.



#### JS_FAILED

The fax job failed.



#### JS_PAUSED

The fax server paused the fax job.



#### JS_NOLINE

There is no line available to send the fax. The fax server will send the transmission when a line is available.



#### JS_RETRYING

The fax job failed. The fax server will attempt to retransmit the fax after a specified interval. For more information about global configuration settings, such as retransmission intervals, see <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winfax/ns-winfax-fax_configurationa">FAX_CONFIGURATION</a>.



#### JS_RETRIES_EXCEEDED

The fax server exceeded the maximum number of retransmission attempts allowed. The fax will not be sent. For more information about global configuration settings, such as the maximum number of retransmission attempts, see <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winfax/ns-winfax-fax_configurationa">FAX_CONFIGURATION</a>.

### -field Status

## -remarks

A fax client application passes the <b>FAX_JOB_ENTRY</b> structure in a call to the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/winfax/nf-winfax-faxsetjoba">FaxSetJob</a> function.

An application can call the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/winfax/nf-winfax-faxenumjobsa">FaxEnumJobs</a> function to enumerate all queued and active fax jobs on the fax server of interest. <b>FaxEnumJobs</b> returns an array of <b>FAX_JOB_ENTRY</b> structures. Each structure describes one fax job in detail.

For more information, see <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fax/-mfax-managing-fax-jobs">Managing Fax Jobs</a>.





> [!NOTE]
> The winfax.h header defines FAX_JOB_ENTRY as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
