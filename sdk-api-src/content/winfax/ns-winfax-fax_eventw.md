# FAX_EVENTW structure


## -description


The <b>FAX_EVENT</b> structure represents the contents of an I/O completion packet. The fax server sends the completion packet to notify a fax client application of an asynchronous fax server event.

To create a fax event queue, the fax client application must call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/winfax/nc-winfax-pfaxinitializeeventqueue">FaxInitializeEventQueue</a> function. The queue enables the application to receive notifications of asynchronous events from the fax server.


## -struct-fields




### -field SizeOfStruct

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the <b>FAX_EVENT</b> structure. The fax server sets this member to <b>sizeof(FAX_EVENT)</b>. 


### -field TimeStamp

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-filetime">FILETIME</a></b>

Specifies a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-filetime">FILETIME</a> structure that contains the time at which the fax server generated the event. 


### -field DeviceId

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Specifies a <b>DWORD</b> variable that indicates the permanent line identifier for the fax device of interest. 


### -field EventId

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Specifies a <b>DWORD</b> variable that identifies the current asynchronous event that occurred within the fax server. The following table lists the possible events and their meanings.



#### FEI_DIALING

The sending device is dialing a fax number. 



#### FEI_SENDING

The sending device is transmitting a page of fax data.

The sending device has encountered a busy signal. 



#### FEI_NO_ANSWER

The receiving device does not answer. 



#### FEI_BAD_ADDRESS

The modem device was turned off. 



#### FEI_IDLE

The device is idle. 



#### FEI_FAXSVC_ENDED

The fax service has terminated. For more information, see the following Remarks section.



#### FEI_ANSWERED

The receiving device answered a new call. 



#### FEI_FAXSVC_STARTED

The fax service has started. For more information, see the following Remarks section.



#### FEI_JOB_QUEUED

The fax job has been queued. 



#### FEI_DELETED

The fax job has been processed. The job identifier for the job is no longer valid.



#### FEI_NEVENTS

The total number of fax events received. For more information, see the following Remarks section. 


### -field JobId

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Specifies a unique number that identifies the fax job of interest. If this member is equal to the value 0xffffffff, it indicates an inactive fax job. Note that this number is not a print spooler identification number. 


##### - EventId.FEI_ABORTING

The device is aborting a fax job. 


##### - EventId.FEI_ANSWERED

The receiving device answered a new call. 


##### - EventId.FEI_BAD_ADDRESS

## -remarks



After a fax client application receives the <b>FEI_FAXSVC_ENDED</b> message from the fax service, it will no longer receive fax events. To resume receiving fax events, the application must call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/winfax/nc-winfax-pfaxinitializeeventqueue">FaxInitializeEventQueue</a> function again when the fax service restarts. The application can determine if the fax service is running by using the service control manager.

If the application receives events using notification messages, it can use the <b>FEI_NEVENTS</b> event. If the message is between the application's base window message and the base window message + <b>FEI_NEVENTS</b>, then the application can process the message as a fax window message. An application specifies the base window message using the <i>MessageStart</i> parameter to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/winfax/nc-winfax-pfaxinitializeeventqueue">FaxInitializeEventQueue</a> function; the base window message must be greater than the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/winmsg/wm-user">WM_USER</a> message. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/winfax/nc-winfax-pfaxclose">FaxClose</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fax/-mfax-enabling-an-application-to-receive-notifications-of-fax-events">Enabling an Application to Receive Notifications of Fax Events</a>.
