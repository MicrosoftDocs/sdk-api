# FAX_CONFIGURATIONA structure


## -description


The <b>FAX_CONFIGURATION</b> structure contains information about the global configuration settings of a fax server. The structure includes data on retransmission, branding, archive, and cover page settings; discount rate periods; and the status of the fax server queue.


## -struct-fields




### -field SizeOfStruct

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the <b>FAX_CONFIGURATION</b> structure. The calling application must set this member to <b>sizeof(FAX_CONFIGURATION)</b> before it calls the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/winfax/nf-winfax-faxsetconfigurationa">FaxSetConfiguration</a> function.


### -field Retries

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Specifies a <b>DWORD</b> variable that indicates the number of times the fax server will attempt to retransmit an outgoing fax if the initial transmission fails.


### -field RetryDelay

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Specifies a <b>DWORD</b> variable that indicates the number of minutes that will elapse between retransmission attempts by the fax server.


### -field DirtyDays

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Specifies a <b>DWORD</b> variable that indicates the number of days the fax server will retain an unsent job in the fax job queue. A transmission might not be sent, for example, if an invalid fax number or date is specified, or if the sending device receives a busy signal multiple times.


### -field Branding

Type: <b>BOOL</b>

Specifies a Boolean variable that indicates whether the fax server should generate a brand (banner) at the top of outgoing fax transmissions. If this member is <b>TRUE</b>, the fax server generates a brand that contains transmission-related information like the transmitting station identifier, date, time, and page count.


### -field UseDeviceTsid

Type: <b>BOOL</b>

Specifies a Boolean variable that indicates whether the fax server will use the device's transmitting station identifier instead of the value specified in the <b>Tsid</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winfax/ns-winfax-fax_job_parama">FAX_JOB_PARAM</a> structure. If this member is <b>TRUE</b>, the server uses the device's transmitting station identifier.


### -field ServerCp

Type: <b>BOOL</b>

Specifies a Boolean variable that indicates whether fax client applications can include a user-designed cover page with the fax transmission. If this member is <b>TRUE</b>, the client must use a common cover page stored on the fax server. If this member is <b>FALSE</b>, the client can use a personal cover page file.


### -field PauseServerQueue

Type: <b>BOOL</b>

Specifies a Boolean variable that indicates whether the fax server has paused the fax job queue. If this member is <b>TRUE</b>, the queue has been paused.


### -field StartCheapTime

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winfax/ns-winfax-fax_time">FAX_TIME</a></b>

Specifies a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winfax/ns-winfax-fax_time">FAX_TIME</a> structure that indicates the hour and minute at which the discount period begins. The discount period applies only to outgoing transmissions.


### -field StopCheapTime

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winfax/ns-winfax-fax_time">FAX_TIME</a></b>

Specifies a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winfax/ns-winfax-fax_time">FAX_TIME</a> structure that indicates the hour and minute at which the discount period ends. The discount period applies only to outgoing transmissions.


### -field ArchiveOutgoingFaxes

Type: <b>BOOL</b>

Specifies a Boolean variable that indicates whether the fax server should archive outgoing fax transmissions. If this member is <b>TRUE</b>, the server archives outgoing transmissions in the directory specified by the <b>ArchiveDirectory</b> member.


### -field ArchiveDirectory

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string that contains the fully qualified path of the directory in which outgoing fax transmissions will be archived. The path can be a UNC path or a path beginning with a drive letter. The fax server ignores this member if the <b>ArchiveOutgoingFaxes</b> member is <b>FALSE</b>. This member can be <b>NULL</b> if the <b>ArchiveOutgoingFaxes</b> member is <b>FALSE</b>.


### -field Reserved

 




#### - InboundProfile

Type: <b>LPCSTR</b>

The inbound routing profile used for email.


## -remarks



The fax client application passes the <b>FAX_CONFIGURATION</b> structure in a call to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/winfax/nf-winfax-faxsetconfigurationa">FaxSetConfiguration</a> function to change the global configuration settings for the fax server of interest. If the application calls the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/winfax/nf-winfax-faxgetconfigurationa">FaxGetConfiguration</a> function, it returns the current settings in a <b>FAX_CONFIGURATION</b> structure. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fax/-mfax-fax-server-configuration-management">Fax Server Configuration Management</a>.
