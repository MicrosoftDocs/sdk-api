The <b>FAX_DEVICE_STATUS</b> structure contains information about the current status of a fax device. In addition to the status, the structure also includes data on whether the device is currently sending or receiving a fax transmission, device and station identifiers, sender and recipient names, and routing information.


## -struct-fields




### -field SizeOfStruct

### -field DocumentName

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string to associate with the fax document that the device is currently sending or receiving. This is the user-friendly name that appears in the print spooler.


### -field JobType

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Specifies a <b>DWORD</b> variable that identifies the type of fax job that is currently active on the device. This member can be one of the following job types.



#### JT_SEND

#### JT_RECEIVE

The fax device is receiving a fax document.



#### JT_UNKNOWN

The fax device is in an unknown or idle state.


### -field PhoneNumber

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

If the <b>JobType</b> member is equal to the <b>JT_SEND</b> job type, <b>PhoneNumber</b> is a pointer to a constant null-terminated character string that is the fax number dialed for the outgoing fax transmission.


### -field RoutingString

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

If the <b>JobType</b> member is equal to the <b>JT_RECEIVE</b> job type, <b>RoutingString</b> is a pointer to a constant null-terminated character string that specifies the routing string for an incoming fax. The string must be of the form: 

                    

<code>Canonical-Phone-Number[|Additional-Routing-Info]</code>

where <code>Canonical-Phone-Number</code> is defined in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Tapi/address-ovr">Address</a> topic of the TAPI documentation (see the Canonical Address subheading); and <code>Additional-Routing-Info</code> is the <i>subaddress</i> of a Canonical Address, and uses the subaddress format.


### -field SenderName

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string that specifies the name of the sender who initiated the fax transmission.


### -field RecipientName

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string that specifies the name of the recipient of the fax transmission.


### -field Size

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Specifies a <b>DWORD</b> variable that indicates the size, in bytes, of the active fax document.


### -field StartTime

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-filetime">FILETIME</a></b>

Specifies a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-filetime">FILETIME</a> structure that contains the starting time of the current fax job expressed in UTC.


### -field Status

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Specifies a <b>DWORD</b> variable that is a fax device status code or value. This member can be one of the predefined device status codes shown following.



#### FPS_DIALING

The device is dialing a fax number.



#### FPS_SENDING

The device is sending a fax document.



#### FPS_RECEIVING

The device is receiving a fax document.



#### FPS_COMPLETED

The device has completed sending or receiving a fax transmission.



#### FPS_UNAVAILABLE

The device is not available because it is in use by another application.



#### FPS_BUSY

The device has encountered a busy signal.



#### FPS_NO_ANSWER

The receiving device did not answer the call.



#### FPS_BAD_ADDRESS

The device dialed an invalid fax number.



#### FPS_NO_DIAL_TONE

The sending device cannot complete the call because it does not detect a dial tone.



#### FPS_DISCONNECTED

### -field TotalPages

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Specifies a <b>DWORD</b> variable that indicates the total number of pages in the fax transmission.


### -field Tsid

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string that specifies the transmitting station identifier (TSID). This identifier is usually a telephone number.


### -field UserName

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string that specifies the name of the user who submitted the active fax job.


## -remarks



The fax client application can call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/winfax/nf-winfax-faxgetdevicestatusa">FaxGetDeviceStatus</a> function to retrieve status information for the fax device of interest. The function returns the information in a <b>FAX_DEVICE_STATUS</b> structure.

For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fax/-mfax-fax-device-management">Fax Device Management</a>. For information about the status information a fax service provider supplies for an active fax operation, see the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/faxdev/ns-faxdev-fax_dev_status">FAX_DEV_STATUS</a> topic.
