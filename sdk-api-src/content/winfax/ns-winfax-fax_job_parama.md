## -remarks

A fax client application passes the <b>FAX_JOB_PARAM</b> structure in a call to the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/winfax/nf-winfax-faxsenddocumenta">FaxSendDocument</a> function to inform the fax server how and when to send the fax transmission. For more information, see <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fax/-mfax-sending-a-fax-to-one-recipient-win32-environment-">Sending a Fax to One Recipient (Win32 Environment)</a>.





> [!NOTE]
> The winfax.h header defines FAX_JOB_PARAM as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
