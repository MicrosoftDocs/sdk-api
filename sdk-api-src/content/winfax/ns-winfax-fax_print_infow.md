## -remarks

A fax client application passes the <b>FAX_PRINT_INFO</b> structure in a call to the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/winfax/nf-winfax-faxstartprintjoba">FaxStartPrintJob</a> function to start a print job on a specified fax printer. For more information, see <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fax/-mfax-printing-a-fax-to-a-device-context">Printing a Fax to a Device Context</a>.





> [!NOTE]
> The winfax.h header defines FAX_PRINT_INFO as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
