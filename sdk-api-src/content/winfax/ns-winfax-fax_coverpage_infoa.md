## -remarks

A fax client application passes the <b>FAX_COVERPAGE_INFO</b> structure in a call to the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/winfax/nf-winfax-faxprintcoverpagea">FaxPrintCoverPage</a> function. This enables a user to print a personal cover page at the beginning of a fax transmission. For more information, see <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fax/-mfax-cover-pages">Cover Pages</a> and <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fax/-mfax-transmitting-faxes">Transmitting Faxes</a>.





> [!NOTE]
> The winfax.h header defines FAX_COVERPAGE_INFO as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
