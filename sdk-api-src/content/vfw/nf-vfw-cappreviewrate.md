# capPreviewRate macro


## -description

The <b>capPreviewRate</b> macro sets the frame display rate in preview mode. You can use this macro or explicitly call the <a href="/windows/desktop/Multimedia/wm-cap-set-previewrate">WM_CAP_SET_PREVIEWRATE</a> message.

## -parameters

### -param hwnd

Handle to a capture window.

### -param wMS

Rate, in milliseconds, at which new frames are captured and displayed.

## -remarks

The preview mode uses substantial CPU resources. Applications can disable preview or lower the preview rate when another application has the focus. During streaming video capture, the previewing task is lower priority than writing frames to disk, and preview frames are displayed only if no other buffers are available for writing.
