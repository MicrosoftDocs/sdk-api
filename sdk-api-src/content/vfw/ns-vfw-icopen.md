# ICOPEN structure


## -description



The <b>ICOPEN</b> structure contains information about the data stream being compressed or decompressed, the version number of the driver, and how the driver is used.




## -struct-fields




### -field dwSize

Size, in bytes, of the structure.


### -field fccType

Four-character code indicating the type of stream being compressed or decompressed. Specify "VIDC" for video streams.


### -field fccHandler

Four-character code identifying a specific compressor.


### -field dwVersion

Version of the installable driver interface used to open the driver.


### -field dwFlags

Applicable flags indicating why the driver is opened. The following values are defined:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="ICMODE_COMPRESS"></a><a id="icmode_compress"></a><dl>
<dt><b>ICMODE_COMPRESS</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Driver is opened to compress data.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="ICMODE_DECOMPRESS"></a><a id="icmode_decompress"></a><dl>
<dt><b>ICMODE_DECOMPRESS</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Driver is opened to decompress data.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="ICMODE_DRAW"></a><a id="icmode_draw"></a><dl>
<dt><b>ICMODE_DRAW</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Device driver is opened to decompress data directly to hardware.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="ICMODE_QUERY"></a><a id="icmode_query"></a><dl>
<dt><b>ICMODE_QUERY</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Driver is opened for informational purposes, rather than for compression.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field dwError


### -field pV1Reserved

Reserved; do not use.


### -field pV2Reserved

Reserved; do not use.


### -field dnDevNode

Device node for plug and play devices.


## -remarks



This structure is passed to video capture drivers when they are opened. This allows a single installable driver to function as either an installable compressor or a video capture device. By examining the <b>fccType</b> member of the <b>ICOPEN</b> structure, the driver can determine its function. For example, a <b>fccType</b> value of "VIDC" indicates that it is opened as an installable video compressor.
