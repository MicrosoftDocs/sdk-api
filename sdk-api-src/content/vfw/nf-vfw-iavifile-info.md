# IAVIFile::Info


## -description



The <b>Info</b> method returns with information about an AVI file. Called when an application uses the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vfw/nf-vfw-avifileinfo">AVIFileInfo</a> function.




## -parameters




### -param pfi

A pointer to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vfw/ns-vfw-avifileinfoa">AVIFILEINFO</a> structure. The method fills the structure with information about the file.


### -param lSize

The size, in bytes, of the buffer specified by <i>pfi</i>.


#### - pf

Pointer to the interface to a file.
          


## -returns



Returns the HRESULT defined by OLE.
          




## -remarks



If the buffer allocated is too small for the structure, this method should fail the call by returning AVIERR_BUFFERTOOSMALL. Otherwise, it should fill the structure and return its size.

For handlers written in C++, <b>Info</b> has the following syntax:


```cpp

HRESULT Info(AVIFILEINFO *pfi, LONG lSize) 
 

```
