# MCIWndRecord macro


## -description

The <b>MCIWndRecord</b> macro begins recording content using the MCI device. The recording process begins at the current position in the content and will overwrite existing data for the duration of the recording.

## -parameters

### -param hwnd

Handle of the MCIWnd window.

## -remarks

The function that an MCI device performs during recording depends on the characteristics of the device. An MCI device that uses files, such as a waveform-audio device, sends data to the file during recording. An MCI device that does not use files, such as a video-cassette recorder, receives and externally records data on another medium.
