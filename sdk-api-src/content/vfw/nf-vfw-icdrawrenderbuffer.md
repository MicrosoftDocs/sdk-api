# ICDrawRenderBuffer macro


## -description



The <b>ICDrawRenderBuffer</b> macro notifies a rendering driver to draw the frames that have been passed to it. You can use this macro or explicitly call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Multimedia/icm-draw-renderbuffer">ICM_DRAW_RENDERBUFFER</a> message.




## -parameters




### -param hic

Handle to a driver. 


## -remarks



Use this message with hardware that performs its own asynchronous decompression, timing, and drawing.

This message is typically used to perform a seek operation when the driver must be specifically instructed to display each video frame passed to it rather than playing a sequence of video frames.
