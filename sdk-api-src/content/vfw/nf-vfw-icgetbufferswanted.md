# ICGetBuffersWanted macro


## -description



The <b>ICGetBuffersWanted</b> macro queries a driver for the number of buffers to allocate. You can use this macro or explicitly call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Multimedia/icm-getbufferswanted">ICM_GETBUFFERSWANTED</a> message.




## -parameters




### -param hic

Handle to a driver. 


### -param lpdwBuffers

Address to contain the number of samples the driver needs to efficiently render the data. 


## -remarks



This message is used by drivers that use hardware to render data and want to ensure a minimal time lag caused by waiting for buffers to arrive. For example, if a driver controls a video decompression board that can hold 10 frames of video, it could return 10 for this message. This instructs applications to try to stay 10 frames ahead of the frame it currently needs.
