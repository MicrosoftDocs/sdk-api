# ICDrawWindow macro


## -description

The <b>ICDrawWindow</b> macro notifies a rendering driver that the window specified for the <a href="/windows/desktop/Multimedia/icm-draw-begin">ICM_DRAW_BEGIN</a> message needs to be redrawn. The window has moved or become temporarily obscured. You can use this macro or explicitly call the <a href="/windows/desktop/Multimedia/icm-draw-window">ICM_DRAW_WINDOW</a> message.

## -parameters

### -param hic

Handle to a driver.

### -param prc

Pointer to the destination rectangle in screen coordinates. If this parameter points to an empty rectangle, drawing should be turned off.

## -remarks

This message is supported by hardware that performs its own asynchronous decompression, timing, and drawing.

Video-overlay drivers use this message to draw when the window is obscured or moved. When a window specified for <a href="/windows/desktop/Multimedia/icm-draw-begin">ICM_DRAW_BEGIN</a> is completely hidden by other windows, the destination rectangle is empty. Drivers should turn off video-overlay hardware when this condition occurs.
