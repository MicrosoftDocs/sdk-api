# ICDrawGetTime macro


## -description

The <b>ICDrawGetTime</b> macro requests a rendering driver that controls the timing of drawing frames to return the current value of its internal clock. You can use this macro or explicitly call the <a href="/windows/desktop/Multimedia/icm-draw-gettime">ICM_DRAW_GETTIME</a> message.

## -parameters

### -param hic

Handle to a driver.

### -param lplTime

Address to contain the current time. The return value should be specified in samples.

## -remarks

This message is generally supported by hardware that performs its own asynchronous decompression, timing, and drawing. The message can also be sent if the hardware is being used as the synchronization master.
