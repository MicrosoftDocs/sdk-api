# HTTP_KNOWN_HEADER structure


## -description


The 
<b>HTTP_KNOWN_HEADER</b> structure contains the header values for a known header from an HTTP request or HTTP response.


## -struct-fields




### -field RawValueLength

Size, in bytes,  of the 8-bit string pointed to by the <b>pRawValue</b> member, not counting a terminating null character, if present. If <b>RawValueLength</b> is zero, then the value of the <b>pRawValue</b> element is meaningless.


### -field pRawValue

Pointer to the text of this HTTP header. Use <b>RawValueLength</b> to determine where this text ends rather than relying on the string to have a terminating null. The format of the header text is specified in 
<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">RFC 2616</a>.


## -remarks



In the HTTP Server API, known headers are defined as those that are enumerated in the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/http/ne-http-http_header_id">HTTP_HEADER_ID</a> enumeration type. Be aware that there are different lists of different sizes for request and response headers.

For more information about the structure and usage of HTTP headers, see the 
<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">RFC 2616</a>.
