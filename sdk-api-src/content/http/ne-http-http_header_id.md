# HTTP_HEADER_ID enumeration


## -description

The 
<b>HTTP_HEADER_ID</b> enumeration type lists <i>known headers</i> for HTTP requests and responses, and associates an array index with each such header. It is used to size and access the <b>KnownHeaders</b> array members of the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/http/ns-http-http_request_headers">HTTP_REQUEST_HEADERS</a> and 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/http/ns-http-http_response_headers">HTTP_RESPONSE_HEADERS</a> structures.

## -enum-fields

### -field HttpHeaderCacheControl:0

Used to specify caching behavior along the request or response chain, overriding the default caching algorithm.

### -field HttpHeaderConnection:1

Allows the sender to specify options that are desired for that particular connection. These are used for a single connection only and must not be communicated by proxies over further connections.

### -field HttpHeaderDate:2

The Date is a general header field that indicates the time that the request or response was sent.

### -field HttpHeaderKeepAlive:3

Based on the keepalive XML element (see <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2518.txt">RFC 2518</a>, section 12.12.1, page 66); a list of URIs included in the KeepAlive
   header must be "live" after they are copied
   (moved) to the destination.

### -field HttpHeaderPragma:4

Used to include optional, implementation-specific directives that might apply to any recipient along the request/response chain.

### -field HttpHeaderTrailer:5

Indicates that specified header fields are present in the trailer of a message encoded with chunked transfer-coding.

### -field HttpHeaderTransferEncoding:6

Indicates what, if any, transformations have been applied to the message body in transit.

### -field HttpHeaderUpgrade:7

Allows the client to specify one or more other communication protocols it would prefer to use if the server can comply.

### -field HttpHeaderVia:8

The Via header field indicates the path taken by the request.

### -field HttpHeaderWarning:9

This is a response header that contains the 3-digit warn code along with the reason phrase.

### -field HttpHeaderAllow:10

Lists the set of methods supported by the resource identified by the Request-URI.

### -field HttpHeaderContentLength:11

The size of the message body in decimal bytes.

### -field HttpHeaderContentType:12

The media type of the message body.

### -field HttpHeaderContentEncoding:13

The encoding scheme for the message body.

### -field HttpHeaderContentLanguage:14

Provides the natural language of the intended audience.

### -field HttpHeaderContentLocation:15

Location of the resource for the entity enclosed in the message when that entity is accessible from a location separate from the requested resource's URI.

### -field HttpHeaderContentMd5:16

An MD5 digest of the entity-body used to provide end-to-end message integrity check (MIC) of the entity-body.

### -field HttpHeaderContentRange:17

The content range header is sent with a partial entity body to specify where in the full entity body the partial body should be applied.

### -field HttpHeaderExpires:18

The date and time after which the message content expires.

### -field HttpHeaderLastModified:19

Indicates the date and time at which the origin server believes the variant was last modified.

### -field HttpHeaderAccept:20

Used with the INVITE, OPTIONS, and REGISTER methods to indicate what media types are acceptable in the response.

### -field HttpHeaderAcceptCharset:21

Indicates the character sets that are acceptable for the response.

### -field HttpHeaderAcceptEncoding:22

The content encodings that are acceptable in the response.

### -field HttpHeaderAcceptLanguage:23

Used by the client to indicate to the server which language it would prefer to receive reason phrases, session descriptions, or status responses.

### -field HttpHeaderAuthorization:24

The user-agent can authenticate itself with a server by sending the Authorization request header field with the request. The field contains the credentials for the domain that the user is requesting.

### -field HttpHeaderCookie:25

The cookie request header contains data used to maintain client state with the server. Cookie data is obtained from a response sent with <b>HttpHeaderSetCookie</b>.

### -field HttpHeaderExpect:26

Indicates the specific server behaviors that are required by the client.

### -field HttpHeaderFrom:27

The From header field specifies the initiator of the SIP request or response message.

### -field HttpHeaderHost:28

Specifies the Internet host and port number of the requested resource. This is obtained from the original URI given by the user or referring resource.

### -field HttpHeaderIfMatch:29

The If-Match request header field is used with a method to make it conditional. A client that has one or more entities previously obtained from the resource can verify that one of those entities is current by including a list of their associated entity tags in the If-Match header field.

### -field HttpHeaderIfModifiedSince:30

The If-Modified-Since request header field is used with a method to make it conditional. If the requested variant has not been modified since the time specified in this field, an entity is  not  returned from the server; instead, a 304 (not modified) response is returned without any message-body.

### -field HttpHeaderIfNoneMatch:31

The If-None-Match request-header field is used with a method to make
   it conditional. When a client has obtained one or more entities from a resource, it can verify that none of those entities is
   current by including a list of their associated entity tags in the
   If-None-Match header field. The purpose of this feature is to allow
   efficient updates of cached information with a minimum amount of
   transaction overhead, and to prevent a method such as PUT
   from inadvertently modifying an existing resource when the client
   believes that the resource does not exist.

### -field HttpHeaderIfRange:32

If a client has a partial copy of an entity in its cache, and wishes
   to obtain an up-to-date copy of the entire entity, it
   can use the If-Range header. Informally, its meaning is, "if the entity is unchanged, send
   me the part(s) I am missing; otherwise, send me the entire new
   entity."

### -field HttpHeaderIfUnmodifiedSince:33

The If-Unmodified-Since request-header field is used with a method to
   make it conditional. If the requested resource has not been modified
   since the time specified in this field, the server performs the
   requested operation as if the If-Unmodified-Since header were not
   present, but

   if the requested resource has been modified,
   the server returns
   a 412 error (Precondition Failed).

### -field HttpHeaderMaxForwards:34

The maximum number of proxies or gateways that can forward the request.

### -field HttpHeaderProxyAuthorization:35

This header field is used by the client to identify itself with a proxy.

### -field HttpHeaderReferer:36

Allows the client to specify, for the server's benefit, the address (URI) of the resource from which the Request-URI was obtained.

### -field HttpHeaderRange:37

Allows a client to request a part of an entity instead of the whole.

### -field HttpHeaderTe:38

This header field contains the recipient of the SIP request or response message.

### -field HttpHeaderTranslate:39

Allows the client to specify whether it wants the source representation or programmatic interpretation of the requested content.

### -field HttpHeaderUserAgent:40

Indicates what extension transfer-codings the client accepts in the response and whether or not the client  accepts trailer fields in a chunked transfer-coding.

### -field HttpHeaderRequestMaximum:41

Not a value that actually designates a header; instead, it is used to count the enumerated Request headers.

### -field HttpHeaderAcceptRanges:20

Allows the server to indicate its acceptance of range requests for a resource.

### -field HttpHeaderAge:21

Conveys the sender's estimate of the amount of time since the response (or its revalidation) was generated at the origin server.

### -field HttpHeaderEtag:22

Provides the current value of the entity tag for the requested variant.

### -field HttpHeaderLocation:23

Used to redirect the recipient to a location other than the Request-URI for completion of the request or identification of a new resource.

### -field HttpHeaderProxyAuthenticate:24

The response field that must be included as a part of the 407 response. The field includes the authentication scheme and parameters that apply to the proxy for this Request-URI.

### -field HttpHeaderRetryAfter:25

The length of time that the service is expected to be unavailable to the requesting client.

### -field HttpHeaderServer:26

This is a response header field that contains information about the server that is handling the request.

### -field HttpHeaderSetCookie:27

The <b>set-cookie</b> response header contains data used to maintain client state in future requests sent with <b>HttpHeaderCookie</b>.

### -field HttpHeaderVary:28

Indicates the set of request header fields that fully determines, while the response is fresh, whether a cache is permitted to use the response to reply to a subsequent request without revalidation.

### -field HttpHeaderWwwAuthenticate:29

The WWW_Authenticate header field contains the authentication schemes and parameters applicable to the Request-URI.

### -field HttpHeaderResponseMaximum:30

Not a value that actually designates a header; instead, it is used to count the enumerated Response headers.

### -field HttpHeaderMaximum:41

Not a value that actually designates a header; instead, it is used to count all the enumerated headers.
