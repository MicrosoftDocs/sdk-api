# HttpWaitForDisconnect function


## -description


The 
<b>HttpWaitForDisconnect</b> function notifies the application when the connection to an HTTP client is broken for any reason.


## -parameters




### -param RequestQueueHandle [in]

A handle to the request queue that handles requests from the specified connection. A request queue is created and its handle returned by a call to the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/http/nf-http-httpcreaterequestqueue">HttpCreateRequestQueue</a> function.

<b>Windows Server 2003 with SP1 and Windows XP with SP2:  </b>The handle to the request queue is created by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/http/nf-http-httpcreatehttphandle">HttpCreateHttpHandle</a> function.


### -param ConnectionId [in]

Identifier for the connection to the client computer. This value is returned in the <b>ConnectionID</b> member of the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/aa364545(v=vs.85)">HTTP_REQUEST</a> structure by a call to the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/http/nf-http-httpreceivehttprequest">HttpReceiveHttpRequest</a> function.


### -param Overlapped [in]

For asynchronous calls, set <i>pOverlapped</i> to point to an 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-overlapped">OVERLAPPED</a> structure; for synchronous calls, set it to <b>NULL</b>. 




A synchronous call blocks until the connection is broken, whereas an asynchronous call immediately returns ERROR_IO_PENDING and the calling application then uses 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-getoverlappedresult">GetOverlappedResult</a> or I/O completion ports to determine when the operation is completed. For information about using 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-overlapped">OVERLAPPED</a> structures for synchronization, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Sync/synchronization-and-overlapped-input-and-output">Synchronization and Overlapped Input and Output</a>.


## -returns



If the function succeeds, the return value is NO_ERROR.

If the function is used asynchronously, a return value of ERROR_IO_PENDING indicates that the next request is not yet ready and is retrieved later through normal overlapped I/O completion mechanisms.

If the function fails, the return value is one of the following error codes.
