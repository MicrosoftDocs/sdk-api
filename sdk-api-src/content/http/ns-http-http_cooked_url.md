# HTTP_COOKED_URL structure


## -description


The 
<b>HTTP_COOKED_URL</b> structure contains a validated, canonical, UTF-16 Unicode-encoded URL request string together with pointers into it and element lengths. This is the string that the HTTP Server API matches against registered 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Http/urlprefix-strings">UrlPrefix strings</a> in order to route the request appropriately.


## -struct-fields




### -field FullUrlLength

Size, in bytes, of the data pointed to by the <b>pFullUrl</b> member, not including a terminating null character.


### -field HostLength

Size, in bytes, of the data pointed to by the <b>pHost</b> member.


### -field AbsPathLength

Size, in bytes, of the data pointed to by the <b>pAbsPath</b> member.


### -field QueryStringLength

Size, in bytes, of the data pointed to by the <b>pQueryString</b> member.


### -field pFullUrl

Pointer to the scheme element at the beginning of the URL (must be either "http://..." or "https://...").


### -field pHost

Pointer to the first character in the host element, immediately following the double slashes at the end of the scheme element.


### -field pAbsPath

Pointer to the third forward slash ("/") in the string. In a UrlPrefix string, this is the slash immediately preceding the relativeUri element.


### -field pQueryString

Pointer to the first question mark (?) in the string, or <b>NULL</b> if there is none.


## -remarks



For example, if <b>pFullUrl</b> is "http://www.fabrikam.com/path1/path2/file.ext?n1=v1&amp;n2=v2", then <b>pHost</b> points to "www.fabrikam", <b>pAbsPath</b> points to "/path1/…" and <b>pQueryString</b> points to "?n1=v1…".
