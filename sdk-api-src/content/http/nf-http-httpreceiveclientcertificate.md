# HttpReceiveClientCertificate function


## -description

The 
<b>HttpReceiveClientCertificate</b> function is used by a server application to retrieve a client SSL certificate or channel binding token (CBT).

## -parameters

### -param RequestQueueHandle [in]

A handle to the request queue with which the specified SSL client or CBT is associated. A request queue is created and its handle returned by a call to the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/http/nf-http-httpcreaterequestqueue">HttpCreateRequestQueue</a> function.

<b>Windows Server 2003 with SP1 and Windows XP with SP2:  </b>The handle to the request queue is created by the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/http/nf-http-httpcreatehttphandle">HttpCreateHttpHandle</a> function.

### -param ConnectionId [in]

A value that identifies the connection to the client. This value is obtained from the <b>ConnectionId</b> element of an 
<a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/aa364545(v=vs.85)">HTTP_REQUEST</a> structure filled in by the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/http/nf-http-httpreceivehttprequest">HttpReceiveHttpRequest</a> function.

### -param Flags [in]

A value that modifies the behavior of the <b>HttpReceiveClientCertificate</b> function

<td width="60%">
The <i>pSslClientCertInfo</i> parameter will be populated with CBT data.

This value is supported on Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, and later. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### -param SslClientCertInfo [out]

If the <i>Flags</i> parameter is 0, then this parameter points to an 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/http/ns-http-http_ssl_client_cert_info">HTTP_SSL_CLIENT_CERT_INFO</a> structure into which the function writes the requested client certificate information. The buffer pointed to by the <i>pSslClientCertInfo</i> should be sufficiently large enough to hold the <b>HTTP_SSL_CLIENT_CERT_INFO</b> structure plus the value of the <b>CertEncodedSize</b> member of this structure.

If the <i>Flags</i> parameter is <b>HTTP_RECEIVE_SECURE_CHANNEL_TOKEN</b>, then this parameter points to an 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/http/ns-http-http_request_channel_bind_status">HTTP_REQUEST_CHANNEL_BIND_STATUS</a> structure into which the function writes the requested CBT information. The buffer pointed to by the <i>pSslClientCertInfo</i> should be sufficiently large enough to hold the <b>HTTP_REQUEST_CHANNEL_BIND_STATUS</b>  structure plus the value of the <b>ChannelTokenSize</b> member of this structure.

### -param SslClientCertInfoSize [in]

The size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by the <i>pSslClientCertInfo</i> parameter.

### -param BytesReceived [out, optional]

An optional pointer to a variable that receives  the number of bytes to be written to the structure pointed to by <i>pSslClientCertInfo</i>. If not used, set it to <b>NULL</b>. 




When making an asynchronous call using <i>pOverlapped</i>, set <i>pBytesReceived</i> to <b>NULL</b>. Otherwise, when <i>pOverlapped</i> is set to <b>NULL</b>, <i>pBytesReceived</i> must contain a valid memory address, and not be set to <b>NULL</b>.

### -param Overlapped [in, optional]

For asynchronous calls, set <i>pOverlapped</i> to point to an 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-overlapped">OVERLAPPED</a> structure, or for synchronous calls, set it to <b>NULL</b>. 




A synchronous call blocks until the client certificate is retrieved, whereas an asynchronous call immediately returns <b>ERROR_IO_PENDING</b> and the calling application then uses 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-getoverlappedresult">GetOverlappedResult</a> or I/O completion ports to determine when the operation is completed. For more information about using 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-overlapped">OVERLAPPED</a> structures for synchronization, see the section 
<a href="/windows/desktop/Sync/synchronization-and-overlapped-input-and-output">Synchronization and Overlapped Input and Output</a>.

## -remarks

The behavior of the <b>HttpReceiveClientCertificate</b> function varies based on whether an client SSL certificate or a channel binding token is requested.

In the case of a synchronous call to the <b>HttpReceiveClientCertificate</b> function , the number of bytes received is returned in the value pointed to by the <i>pBytesReceived</i> parameter.

In the case of an asynchronous call to the <b>HttpReceiveClientCertificate</b> function, the number of bytes received is returned by the standard mechanisms used for asynchronous calls. The  <i>lpNumberOfBytesTransferred</i> parameter returned by the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-getoverlappedresult">GetOverlappedResult</a> function contains the number of bytes received.
