# PrintAsyncNotifyUserFilter enumeration


## -description

Specifies whether notifications will go only to listening applications that are associated with the same user as the Print Spooler-hosted sender, or go to a broader set of listening applications.

## -enum-fields

### -field kPerUser

When passed to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/prnasnot/nf-prnasnot-createprintasyncnotifychannel">CreatePrintAsyncNotifyChannel
</a>, kPerUser indicates that notifications will go only to listening applications that are using <a href="/windows/desktop/SecAuthZ/client-impersonation">Client Impersonation</a> to impersonate the same user as the Print Spooler-hosted sender. For example, if the Print Spooler-hosted sender sends a notification that a print job has finished printing, only listening applications impersonating the user that submitted the job will receive notification. When passed to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/prnasnot/nf-prnasnot-registerforprintasyncnotifications">RegisterForPrintAsyncNotifications</a>, kPerUser indicates that the listener will receive notifications only from senders that are impersonating the same user as the listener.

### -field kAllUsers

When passed to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/prnasnot/nf-prnasnot-createprintasyncnotifychannel">CreatePrintAsyncNotifyChannel
</a>, kAllUsers indicates that notifications will go to all listening applications, regardless of the user; as long as the sender has administration privileges on the associated print queue or print server. When passed to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/prnasnot/nf-prnasnot-registerforprintasyncnotifications">RegisterForPrintAsyncNotifications</a>, kAllUsers indicates that notifications will go to all listening applications whose associated user has administration privileges on the print queue or print server.

## -remarks

Regardless of which value is passed, listeners will receive only the types of notifications for which they have registered.

A user may be simultaneously logged on to multiple terminal server sessions. All of the user's applications, regardless of which session hosts them, will receive notifications for which they have registered.
