# IBasicVideo interface


## -description

The <code>IBasicVideo</code> interface sets video properties such as the destination and source rectangles. The <a href="/windows/desktop/DirectShow/video-renderer-filter">Video Renderer</a> filter and Video Mixing Renderer filters implement this interface, but the interface is exposed to applications through the Filter Graph Manager. Applications should always retrieve this interface from the Filter Graph Manager.

The <code>IBasicVideo</code> interface manipulates the following rectangles associated with the video image:

<ul>
<li>The <i>source</i> rectangle is the portion of the original image that gets displayed.</li>
<li>The <i>destination</i> rectangle is the portion of the video window the receives the source rectangle.</li>
<li>The <i>video</i> rectangle is the original video image.</li>
</ul>
In other words, the video renderer crops the image to the source rectangle, and then stretches or shrinks the cropped image to the destination rectangle. All rectangle dimensions are given in pixels.

Properties set on the Video Renderer persist between successive connections and disconnections.

<b>Error codes</b>: If the video renderer filter is not connected to another filter, all methods return the error code VFW_E_NOT_CONNECTED. For the Filter Graph Manager's implementation, if the graph does not contain a video renderer filter, all methods return E_NOINTERFACE. Note that the Filter Graph Manager exposes the interface even when the graph does not contain a video renderer, so an application can query for the interface before it builds the graph.

## -inheritance

The <b>IBasicVideo</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oaidl/nn-oaidl-idispatch">IDispatch</a> interface. <b>IBasicVideo</b> also has these types of members:
