# IFsrmQuotaBase::AddThreshold


## -description

<p class="CCE_Message">[This method is supported for compatibility but it's recommended to use the 
    <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fsrm/fsrm-wmi-classes">FSRM WMI Classes</a> to manage FSRM. Please see the 
    <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fsrm/msft-fsrmquota">MSFT_FSRMQuota</a> class.]

Adds a threshold to the quota object.

## -parameters

### -param threshold [in]

The threshold to add to the quota object. The threshold is expressed as a percentage of the 
      <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/fsrmquota/nf-fsrmquota-ifsrmquotabase-get_quotalimit">quota limit</a>. The value must be from 1 through 
      250, inclusively.

## -returns

The method returns the following return values.

## -remarks

You can specify up to 16 unique thresholds for a quota.

A threshold defines the percentage (as a whole number) of directory quota limit used. When the size of all 
    data in the directory exceeds the threshold, the FSRM server performs the specified actions (see 
    <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/fsrmquota/nf-fsrmquota-ifsrmquotabase-createthresholdaction">IFsrmQuotaBase::CreateThresholdAction</a>).
