# REMOTE_NAME_INFOA structure


## -description

The <b>REMOTE_NAME_INFO</b> structure contains information about the remote form of a universal name. It is used by the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/npapi/nf-npapi-npgetuniversalname">NPGetUniversalName</a> function.

## -struct-fields

### -field lpUniversalName

Pointer to the universal name if the provider supports universal names. Otherwise, this points to <b>NULL</b>.

### -field lpConnectionName

Pointer to a string containing the remote name used to make the connection. This string does not have a trailing backslash.

### -field lpRemainingPath

Pointer to the remaining path that must to be concatenated to a drive letter after a connection is established by means of <b>lpConnectionName</b>, to refer to the object specified during the call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/npapi/nf-npapi-npgetuniversalname">NPGetUniversalName</a>. This string has a backslash at the start of the path.

## -remarks

> [!NOTE]
> The winnetwk.h header defines REMOTE_NAME_INFO as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
