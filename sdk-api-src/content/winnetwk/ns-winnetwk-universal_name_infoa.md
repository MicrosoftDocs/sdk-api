# UNIVERSAL_NAME_INFOA structure


## -description

The <b>UNIVERSAL_NAME_INFO</b> structure contains information about the UNC form of a universal name. It is used by the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/npapi/nf-npapi-npgetuniversalname">NPGetUniversalName</a> function.

## -struct-fields

### -field lpUniversalName

If the provider supports a universal name, it will return that here.

## -remarks

> [!NOTE]
> The winnetwk.h header defines UNIVERSAL_NAME_INFO as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
