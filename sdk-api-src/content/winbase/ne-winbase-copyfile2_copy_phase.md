# COPYFILE2_COPY_PHASE enumeration


## -description


Indicates the phase of a copy at the time of an error. This is used in the 
    <b>Error</b> structure embedded in the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/ns-winbase-copyfile2_message">COPYFILE2_MESSAGE</a> structure.


## -enum-fields




### -field COPYFILE2_PHASE_NONE

The copy had not yet started processing.


### -field COPYFILE2_PHASE_PREPARE_SOURCE

The source was being prepared including opening a handle to the source. This phase happens once per stream 
      copy operation.


### -field COPYFILE2_PHASE_PREPARE_DEST

The destination was being prepared including opening a handle to the destination. This phase happens once 
      per stream copy operation.


### -field COPYFILE2_PHASE_READ_SOURCE

The source file was being read. This phase happens one or more times per stream copy operation.


### -field COPYFILE2_PHASE_WRITE_DESTINATION

The destination file was being written. This phase happens one or more times per stream copy 
      operation.


### -field COPYFILE2_PHASE_SERVER_COPY

Both the source and destination were on the same remote server and the copy was being processed remotely. 
      This phase happens once per stream copy operation.


### -field COPYFILE2_PHASE_NAMEGRAFT_COPY

The copy operation was processing symbolic links and/or reparse points. This phase happens once per file 
      copy operation.


### -field COPYFILE2_PHASE_MAX

One greater than the maximum value. Valid values for this enumeration will be less than this value.


## -remarks



To compile an application that uses this enumeration, define the <b>_WIN32_WINNT</b> 
    macro as 0x0601 or later. For more information, see 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/using-the-windows-headers">Using the Windows Headers</a>.
