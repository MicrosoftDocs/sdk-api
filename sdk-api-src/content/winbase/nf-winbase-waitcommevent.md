# WaitCommEvent function


## -description

Waits for an event to occur for a specified communications device. The set of events that are monitored by this function is contained in the event mask associated with the device handle.

## -parameters

### -param hFile [in]

A handle to the communications device. The 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea">CreateFile</a> function returns this handle.

### -param lpEvtMask [out]

A pointer to a variable that receives a mask indicating the type of event that occurred. If an error occurs, the value is zero; otherwise, it is one of the following values.

### -param lpOverlapped [in]

A pointer to an 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-overlapped">OVERLAPPED</a> structure. This structure is required if <i>hFile</i> was opened with <b>FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED</b>. 




If <i>hFile</i> was opened with <b>FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED</b>, the <i>lpOverlapped</i> parameter must not be <b>NULL</b>. It must point to a valid <a href="/windows/desktop/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-overlapped">OVERLAPPED</a> structure. If <i>hFile</i> was opened with <b>FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED</b> and <i>lpOverlapped</i> is <b>NULL</b>, the function can incorrectly report that the operation is complete.

If <i>hFile</i> was opened with <b>FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED</b> and <i>lpOverlapped</i> is not <b>NULL</b>, 
<b>WaitCommEvent</b> is performed as an overlapped operation. In this case, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-overlapped">OVERLAPPED</a> structure must contain a handle to a manual-reset event object (created by using the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-createeventa">CreateEvent</a> function).

If <i>hFile</i> was not opened with <b>FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED</b>, 
<b>WaitCommEvent</b> does not return until one of the specified events or an error occurs.

## -returns

If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero.

If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, call 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a>.

## -remarks

The 
<b>WaitCommEvent</b> function monitors a set of events for a specified communications resource. To set and query the current event mask of a communications resource, use the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-setcommmask">SetCommMask</a> and 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getcommmask">GetCommMask</a> functions.

If the overlapped operation cannot be completed immediately, the function returns <b>FALSE</b> and the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a> function returns <b>ERROR_IO_PENDING</b>, indicating that the operation is executing in the background. When this happens, the system sets the <b>hEvent</b> member of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-overlapped">OVERLAPPED</a> structure to the not-signaled state before 
<b>WaitCommEvent</b> returns, and then it sets it to the signaled state when one of the specified events or an error occurs. The calling process can use one of the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/Sync/wait-functions">wait functions</a> to determine the event object's state and then use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-getoverlappedresult">GetOverlappedResult</a> function to determine the results of the 
<b>WaitCommEvent</b> operation. 
<b>GetOverlappedResult</b> reports the success or failure of the operation, and the variable pointed to by the <i>lpEvtMask</i> parameter is set to indicate the event that occurred.

If a process attempts to change the device handle's event mask by using the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-setcommmask">SetCommMask</a> function while an overlapped 
<b>WaitCommEvent</b> operation is in progress, 
<b>WaitCommEvent</b> returns immediately. The variable pointed to by the <i>lpEvtMask</i> parameter is set to zero.
