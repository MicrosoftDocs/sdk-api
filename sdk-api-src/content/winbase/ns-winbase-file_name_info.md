# FILE_NAME_INFO structure


## -description

Receives the file name. Used for any handles. Use only when calling 
   <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getfileinformationbyhandleex">GetFileInformationByHandleEx</a>.

## -struct-fields

### -field FileNameLength

The size of the <b>FileName</b> string, in bytes.

### -field FileName

The file name that is returned.

## -remarks

If the call to `GetFileInformationByHandleEx` fails because there was not enough
buffer space for the full length of the <b>FileName</b> then the `FileNameLength`
field will contain the required length of the <b>FileName</b> in bytes.
