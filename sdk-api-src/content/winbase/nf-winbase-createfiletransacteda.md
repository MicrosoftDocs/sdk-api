# CreateFileTransactedA function


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[Microsoft strongly recommends developers utilize alternative means to achieve your 
    application’s needs. Many scenarios that TxF was developed for can be achieved through simpler and more readily 
    available techniques. Furthermore, TxF may not be available in future versions of Microsoft Windows. For more 
    information, and alternatives to TxF, please see 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/deprecation-of-txf">Alternatives to using Transactional NTFS</a>.]

Creates or opens a file, file stream, or directory as a transacted operation. The function 
    returns a handle that can be used to access the object.

To perform this operation as a nontransacted 
    operation or to access objects other than files (for example, named pipes, physical devices, mailslots), use the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea">CreateFile</a> function.

For more information about transactions, see the Remarks section of this topic.


## -parameters




### -param lpFileName [in]

The name of an object to be created or opened.

The object must reside on the local computer; otherwise, 
       the function fails and the last error code is set to 
       <b>ERROR_TRANSACTIONS_UNSUPPORTED_REMOTE</b>.

In the ANSI version of this function, the name is limited to <b>MAX_PATH</b> characters. 
       To extend this limit to 32,767 wide characters, call the Unicode version of the function and prepend 
       "\\?\" to the path. For more information, see 
       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/naming-a-file">Naming a File</a>. For information on special device names, 
       see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/defining-an-ms-dos-device-name">Defining an MS-DOS Device Name</a>.

To create a file stream, specify the name of the file, a colon, and then the name of the stream. For more 
       information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/file-streams">File Streams</a>.


### -param dwDesiredAccess [in]

The access to the object, which can be  summarized as read, write, both or neither (zero). The most commonly 
       used values are <b>GENERIC_READ</b>, <b>GENERIC_WRITE</b>, or both 
       (<b>GENERIC_READ</b> | <b>GENERIC_WRITE</b>). For more information, see 
       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecAuthZ/generic-access-rights">Generic Access Rights</a> and 
       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/file-security-and-access-rights">File Security and Access Rights</a>.

If this parameter is zero, the application can query  file, directory, or device attributes without accessing 
       that file or device. For more information, see the Remarks section of this topic.

You cannot request an access mode that conflicts with the sharing mode that is specified in an open request 
       that has an open handle. For more information, see 
       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/creating-and-opening-files">Creating and Opening Files</a>.


### -param dwShareMode [in]

The sharing mode of an object, which can be read, write, both, delete, all of these, or none (refer to the 
       following table).

If this parameter is zero and 
       <b>CreateFileTransacted</b> succeeds, the object cannot 
       be shared and cannot be opened again until the handle is closed. For more information, see the Remarks section 
       of this topic.

You cannot request a sharing mode that conflicts with the access mode that is specified in an open request 
       that has an open handle, because that would result in the following sharing violation: 
       <b>ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION</b>. For more information, see 
       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/creating-and-opening-files">Creating and Opening Files</a>.

To enable a process to share an object while another process has the object open, use a combination of one or 
       more of the following values to specify the  access mode they can request to open the object.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The sharing options for each open handle remain in effect until that handle is closed, regardless of 
       process context.</div>

### -param lpSecurityAttributes [in, optional]

A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/aa379560(v=vs.85)">SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES</a> 
       structure that contains an optional 
       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winnt/ns-winnt-security_descriptor">security descriptor</a> and also determines whether 
       or not the returned handle can be inherited by child processes. The parameter can be 
       <b>NULL</b>.

If the <i>lpSecurityAttributes</i> parameter is <b>NULL</b>, the handle 
       returned by <b>CreateFileTransacted</b> cannot be 
       inherited by any child processes your application may create and the object associated with the returned handle 
       gets a default security descriptor.

The <b>bInheritHandle</b> member of the structure specifies whether the returned handle 
       can be inherited.

The  <b>lpSecurityDescriptor</b> member of the structure specifies 
       a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winnt/ns-winnt-security_descriptor">security descriptor</a> for an object, but may 
       also be <b>NULL</b>.

If <b>lpSecurityDescriptor</b> member is <b>NULL</b>, the object 
       associated with the returned handle is assigned a default security descriptor.

<b>CreateFileTransacted</b> ignores the 
       <b>lpSecurityDescriptor</b> member when opening an existing file, but continues to use the 
       <b>bInheritHandle</b> member.

For more information, see the Remarks section of this topic.


### -param dwCreationDisposition [in]

An action to take on files that exist and  do not exist.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -param dwFlagsAndAttributes [in]

The file attributes and flags, <b>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL</b> being the most common default 
       value.

This parameter can include any combination of the available file attributes 
       (<b>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_*</b>). All other file attributes override 
       <b>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL</b>.

This parameter can also contain combinations of flags (<b>FILE_FLAG_*</b>) for control of 
       buffering behavior, access modes, and other special-purpose flags. These combine with any 
       <b>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_*</b> values.

This parameter can also contain Security Quality of Service (SQOS) information by specifying the 
       <b>SECURITY_SQOS_PRESENT</b> flag. Additional SQOS-related flags information is presented in 
       the table following the attributes and flags tables.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  <p class="note">When <b>CreateFileTransacted</b> opens an existing 
        file, it generally combines the file flags with the file attributes of the existing file, and ignores any file 
        attributes supplied as part of <i>dwFlagsAndAttributes</i>. Special cases are detailed in 
        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/creating-and-opening-files">Creating and Opening Files</a>.

<div> </div>
The following file attributes and flags are used only for file objects, not other types of objects that 
       <b>CreateFileTransacted</b> opens (additional 
       information can be found in the Remarks section of this topic). For more advanced access to file attributes, 
       see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-setfileattributesa">SetFileAttributes</a>. For a complete list of all

The file is being used for temporary storage.  File systems avoid writing data back to mass storage 
         if sufficient cache memory is available, because an application deletes a temporary file after a handle is 
         closed. In that case, the system can entirely avoid writing the data.  Otherwise, the data is written after 
         the handle is closed.

The file is being opened or created for a backup or restore operation. The system ensures that the

         <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecBP/changing-privileges-in-a-token">Changing Privileges in a Token</a>.

You must set this flag to obtain a handle to a directory. A directory handle can be passed to some 
         functions instead of a file handle. For more information, see

         provided that the transaction is still active. If a file has been marked for deletion and a transacted writer 
         handle is still open after the transaction completes, the file will not be deleted.

If there are existing open handles to a file, the call fails unless they were all opened with the 
         <b>FILE_SHARE_DELETE</b> share mode.

Subsequent open requests for the file fail, unless the <b>FILE_SHARE_DELETE</b> share

<td width="60%">
The file is being opened with no system caching. This flag does not affect hard disk caching or memory 
         mapped files. When combined with <b>FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED</b>, the flag gives maximum 
         asynchronous performance, because the I/O does not rely on the synchronous operations of the memory manager. 
         However, some I/O operations take more time, because data is not being held in the cache. Also, the file 
         metadata may still be cached. To flush the metadata to disk, use the 
         <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-flushfilebuffers">FlushFileBuffers</a> function.

An application must meet certain requirements when working with files that are opened with 
         <b>FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING</b>:

<ul>
<li>File access must begin at byte offsets within a file that are integer multiples of the volume sector 
          size.</li>
<li>File access must be for numbers of bytes that are integer multiples of the volume sector size. For 
          example, if the sector size is 512 bytes, an application can request reads and writes of 512, 1024, 1536, 
          or 2048 bytes, but not of 335, 981, or 7171 bytes.</li>
<li>Buffer addresses for read and write operations should be sector aligned, which means aligned on 
          addresses in memory that are integer multiples of the volume sector size. Depending on the disk, this 
          requirement may not be enforced.</li>
</ul>
One way to align buffers on integer multiples of the volume sector size is to use 
         <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc">VirtualAlloc</a> to allocate the buffers. It allocates 
         memory that is aligned on addresses that are integer multiples of the operating system's memory page size. 
         Because both memory page and volume sector sizes are powers of 2, this memory is also aligned on addresses 
         that are integer multiples of a volume sector size. Memory pages are 4 or 8 KB in size; sectors are 512 bytes 
         (hard disks), 2048 bytes (CD), or 4096 bytes (hard disks), and therefore, volume sectors can never be larger 
         than memory pages.

An application can determine a volume sector size by calling the 
         <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-getdiskfreespacea">GetDiskFreeSpace</a> function.

### -param lpExtendedParameter

This parameter is reserved and must be <b>NULL</b>.


## -returns



If the function succeeds, the return value is an open handle to the specified file, device, named pipe, or 
       mail slot.

If the function fails, the return value is <b>INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE</b>. To get extended 
       error information, call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a>.




## -remarks



When using the handle returned by 
     <b>CreateFileTransacted</b>, use the transacted version 
     of file I/O functions instead of the standard file I/O functions where appropriate. For more information, see 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/programming-considerations-for-transacted-fileio-">Programming Considerations for 
     Transactional NTFS</a>.

When opening a transacted handle to a directory, that handle must have 
     <b>FILE_WRITE_DATA</b> (<b>FILE_ADD_FILE</b>) and 
     <b>FILE_APPEND_DATA</b> (<b>FILE_ADD_SUBDIRECTORY</b>) permissions. These 
     are included in <b>FILE_GENERIC_WRITE</b> permissions. You should open directories with fewer 
     permissions if you are just using the handle to create files or subdirectories; otherwise, sharing violations can 
     occur.

You cannot open a file with <b>FILE_EXECUTE</b> access level when that file is a part of 
     another transaction (that is, another application opened it by calling 
     <b>CreateFileTransacted</b>).  This means that 
     <b>CreateFileTransacted</b> fails if the access level 
     <b>FILE_EXECUTE</b> or <b>FILE_ALL_ACCESS</b> is specified

When a non-transacted application calls 
     <b>CreateFileTransacted</b> with 
     <b>MAXIMUM_ALLOWED</b> specified for <i>lpSecurityAttributes</i>, a handle 
     is opened with the same access level every time.  When a transacted application calls 
     <b>CreateFileTransacted</b> with 
     <b>MAXIMUM_ALLOWED</b> specified for <i>lpSecurityAttributes</i>, a handle 
     is opened with a differing amount of access based on whether the file is locked by a transaction. For example, 
     if the calling application has <b>FILE_EXECUTE</b> access level for a file, the application 
     only obtains this access if the file that is being opened is either not locked by a transaction, or is locked by 
     a transaction and the application is already a transacted reader for that file.

See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/transactional-ntfs-portal">Transactional NTFS</a> for a complete 
     description of transacted operations.

Use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle">CloseHandle</a> function to close an object handle 
     returned by <b>CreateFileTransacted</b> when the handle 
     is no longer needed, and prior to committing or rolling back the transaction.

Some file systems, such as the NTFS file system, support compression or encryption for individual files and 
     directories. On volumes that are formatted for that kind of file system, a new file inherits the compression and 
     encryption attributes of its directory.

You cannot use <b>CreateFileTransacted</b> to control 
     compression on a file or directory. For more information, see 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/file-compression-and-decompression">File Compression and Decompression</a>, and 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/file-encryption">File Encryption</a>.

Symbolic link behavior—If the call to this function creates a new file, there is no change 
     in behavior.

If <b>FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT</b> is specified:

<ul>
<li>If an existing file is opened and it is a symbolic link, the handle returned is a handle to the symbolic 
       link.</li>
<li>If <b>TRUNCATE_EXISTING</b> or <b>FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE</b> are 
       specified, the file affected is a symbolic link.</li>
</ul>
If <b>FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT</b> is not specified:

<ul>
<li>If an existing file is opened and it is a symbolic link, the handle returned is a handle to the 
       target.</li>
<li>If <b>CREATE_ALWAYS</b>, <b>TRUNCATE_EXISTING</b>, or 
       <b>FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE</b> are specified, the file affected is the target.</li>
</ul>
A multi-sector write is not guaranteed to be atomic unless you are using a transaction (that is, the handle 
    created is a transacted handle).  A single-sector write is atomic. Multi-sector writes that are cached may not 
    always be written to the disk; therefore, specify <b>FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH</b> to ensure that 
    an entire multi-sector write is written to the disk without caching.

As stated previously, if the <i>lpSecurityAttributes</i> parameter is 
     <b>NULL</b>, the handle returned by 
     <b>CreateFileTransacted</b> cannot be inherited by any 
     child processes your application may create. The following information regarding this parameter also applies:

<ul>
<li>If <b>bInheritHandle</b> is not <b>FALSE</b>, which is any nonzero 
      value, then the handle can be inherited. Therefore it is critical this structure member be properly initialized 
      to <b>FALSE</b> if you do not intend the handle to be inheritable.</li>
<li>The access control lists (ACL) in the default security descriptor for a file or directory are inherited 
      from its parent directory.</li>
<li>The target file system must support security on files and directories for the 
      <b>lpSecurityDescriptor</b>  to have an effect on them, which can be determined by using 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-getvolumeinformationa">GetVolumeInformation</a>
</li>
</ul>

If you try to create a file on a floppy drive that does not have a floppy disk or a CD-ROM drive that does not 
      have a CD, the system displays a message for the user to insert a disk or a CD. To prevent the system from 
      displaying this message, call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-seterrormode">SetErrorMode</a> function 
      with <b>SEM_FAILCRITICALERRORS</b>.

For more information, see 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/creating-and-opening-files">Creating and Opening Files</a>.

If you rename or delete a file and then restore it shortly afterward, the system searches the cache for file 
      information to restore. Cached information includes its short/long name pair and creation time.

If you call <b>CreateFileTransacted</b> on a file that 
      is pending deletion as a result of a previous call to 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-deletefilea">DeleteFile</a>, the function fails. The operating system 
      delays file deletion until all handles to the file are closed.
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a> returns 
      <b>ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED</b>.

The <i>dwDesiredAccess</i> parameter can 
      be zero, allowing the application to query  file attributes without accessing the file if the application is 
      running with adequate security settings. This is useful to test for the existence of a file without opening it 
      for read and/or write access, or to obtain other statistics about the file or directory. See 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/obtaining-and-setting-file-information">Obtaining and Setting File Information</a> 
      and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-getfileinformationbyhandle">GetFileInformationByHandle</a>.

When an application creates a file across a network, it is better to use 
      <b>GENERIC_READ</b> | <b>GENERIC_WRITE</b> than to use 
      <b>GENERIC_WRITE</b> alone. The resulting code is faster, because the redirector can use the 
      cache manager and send fewer SMBs with more data. This combination also avoids an issue where writing to a file 
      across a network can occasionally return <b>ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED</b>.

<h3><a id="File_Streams"></a><a id="file_streams"></a><a id="FILE_STREAMS"></a>File Streams</h3>
On NTFS file systems, you can use 
      <b>CreateFileTransacted</b> to create separate streams 
      within a file.

For more information, see 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/file-streams">File Streams</a>.

<h3><a id="Directories"></a><a id="directories"></a><a id="DIRECTORIES"></a>Directories</h3>
An application cannot create a directory by using 
      <b>CreateFileTransacted</b>, therefore only the 
      <b>OPEN_EXISTING</b> value is valid for <i>dwCreationDisposition</i> for 
      this use case. To create a directory, the application must call 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-createdirectorytransacteda">CreateDirectoryTransacted</a>, 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createdirectorya">CreateDirectory</a> or 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-createdirectoryexa">CreateDirectoryEx</a>.

To open a directory using <b>CreateFileTransacted</b>, 
      specify the <b>FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS</b> flag as part of 
      <i>dwFlagsAndAttributes</i>. Appropriate security checks still apply when this flag is used 
      without <b>SE_BACKUP_NAME</b> and <b>SE_RESTORE_NAME</b> privileges.

When using <b>CreateFileTransacted</b> to open a 
      directory during defragmentation of a FAT or FAT32 file system volume, do not specify the 
      <b>MAXIMUM_ALLOWED</b> access right. Access to the directory is denied if this is done. 
      Specify the <b>GENERIC_READ</b> access right instead.
