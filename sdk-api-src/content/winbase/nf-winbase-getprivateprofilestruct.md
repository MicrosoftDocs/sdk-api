# GetPrivateProfileStruct function


## -description

Retrieves the data associated with a key in the specified section of an initialization file. As it retrieves the data, the function calculates a checksum and compares it with the checksum calculated by the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-writeprivateprofilestructa">WritePrivateProfileStruct</a> function when the data was added to the file.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This function is provided only for compatibility with 16-bit Windows-based applications. Applications should store initialization information in the registry.</div><div> </div>

## -parameters

### -param lpszSection [in]

The name of the section in the initialization file.

### -param lpszKey [in]

The name of the key whose data is to be retrieved.

### -param lpStruct [out]

A pointer to the buffer that receives the data associated with the file, section, and key names.

### -param uSizeStruct [in]

The size of the buffer pointed to by the <i>lpStruct</i> parameter, in bytes.

### -param szFile [in]

The name of the initialization file. If this parameter does not contain a full path to the file, the system searches for the file in the Windows directory.

## -returns

If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero.

If the function fails, the return value is zero.

## -remarks

A section in the initialization file must have the following form:
				
			


``` syntax
[section]
key=data
      .
      .
      .
```

The system maps most .ini file references to the registry, using the mapping defined under the following registry key:<b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</b>&#92;<b>SOFTWARE</b>&#92;<b>Microsoft</b>&#92;<b>Windows NT</b>&#92;<b>CurrentVersion</b>&#92;<b>IniFileMapping</b>



This mapping is likely if an application modifies system-component initialization files, such as Control.ini, System.ini, and Winfile.ini. In these cases, the 
 function retrieves information from the registry, not from the initialization file; the change in the storage location has no effect on the function's behavior.

The profile functions use the following steps to locate initialization information:

<ol>
<li>Look in the registry for the name of the initialization file, say MyFile.ini, under <b>IniFileMapping</b>.</li>
<li>Look for the section name specified by <i>lpAppName</i>. This will be a named value under <b>myfile.ini</b>, or a subkey of <b>myfile.ini</b>, or will not exist.</li>
<li>If the section name specified by <i>lpAppName</i> is a named value under <b>myfile.ini</b>, then that value specifies where in the registry you will find the keys for the section.</li>
<li>If the section name specified by <i>lpAppName</i> is a subkey of <b>myfile.ini</b>, then named values under that subkey specify where in the registry you will find the keys for the section. If the key you are looking for does not exist as a named value, then there will be an unnamed value (shown as <b>&lt;No Name&gt;</b>) that specifies the default location in the registry where you will find the key.</li>
<li>If the section name specified by <i>lpAppName</i> does not exist as a named value or as a subkey under <b>myfile.ini</b>, then there will be an unnamed value (shown as <b>&lt;No Name&gt;</b>) under <b>myfile.ini</b> that specifies the default location in the registry where you will find the keys for the section.</li>
<li>If there is no <b>myfile.ini</b> subkey, or if it does not contain an entry for the section name, then look for the actual MyFile.ini on the disk and read its contents.</li>
</ol>
When looking at values in the registry that specify other registry locations, there are several prefixes that change the behavior of the .ini file mapping:

<ul>
<li>! - this character forces all writes to go both to the registry and to the .ini file on disk.</li>
<li># - this character causes the registry value to be set to the value in the Windows 3.1 .ini file when a new user logs in for the first time after setup.</li>
<li>@ - this character prevents any reads from going to the .ini file on disk if the requested data is not found in the registry.</li>
<li>USR: - this prefix stands for <b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</b>, and the text after the prefix is relative to that key.</li>
<li>SYS: - this prefix stands for <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE</b>, and the text after the prefix is relative to that key.</li>
</ul>
