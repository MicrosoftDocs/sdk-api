# FILE_STORAGE_INFO structure


## -description


Contains directory information for a file. This structure is returned from the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getfileinformationbyhandleex">GetFileInformationByHandleEx</a> function when 
    <b>FileStorageInfo</b> is passed in the <i>FileInformationClass</i> 
    parameter.


## -struct-fields




### -field LogicalBytesPerSector

Logical bytes per sector  reported by physical storage. This is the smallest size for which uncached I/O is 
      supported.


### -field PhysicalBytesPerSectorForAtomicity

Bytes per sector for atomic writes. Writes smaller than this may require a read before the entire block can 
      be written atomically.


### -field PhysicalBytesPerSectorForPerformance

Bytes per sector for optimal performance for writes.


### -field FileSystemEffectivePhysicalBytesPerSectorForAtomicity

This is the size of the block used for atomicity by the file system. This may be a trade-off between the 
      optimal size of the physical media and one that is easier to adapt existing code and structures.


### -field Flags

This member can contain combinations of flags specifying information about the alignment of the 
      storage.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="STORAGE_INFO_FLAGS_ALIGNED_DEVICE"></a><a id="storage_info_flags_aligned_device"></a><dl>
<dt><b>STORAGE_INFO_FLAGS_ALIGNED_DEVICE</b></dt>
<dt>0x00000001</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
When set, this flag indicates that the logical sectors of the storage device are aligned to physical 
        sector boundaries.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="STORAGE_INFO_FLAGS_PARTITION_ALIGNED_ON_DEVICE____"></a><a id="storage_info_flags_partition_aligned_on_device____"></a><dl>
<dt><b>STORAGE_INFO_FLAGS_PARTITION_ALIGNED_ON_DEVICE    </b></dt>
<dt>0x00000002</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
When set, this flag indicates that the partition is aligned to physical sector boundaries on the 
        storage device.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field ByteOffsetForSectorAlignment

Logical sector offset within the first physical sector where the first logical sector is placed, in bytes. 
      If this value is set to <b>STORAGE_INFO_OFFSET_UNKNOWN</b> (0xffffffff), there was 
      insufficient information to compute this field.


### -field ByteOffsetForPartitionAlignment

Offset used to align the partition to a physical sector boundary on the storage device, in bytes. If this 
      value is set to <b>STORAGE_INFO_OFFSET_UNKNOWN</b> (0xffffffff), there was insufficient 
      information to compute this field.


## -remarks



If a volume is built on top of storage devices with different properties (for example a mirrored, spanned, 
    striped, or RAID configuration) the sizes returned are those of the largest size of any of the underlying storage 
    devices.
