# BackupRead function


## -description

The <b>BackupRead</b> function can be used to back up 
    a file or directory, including the security information. The function reads data associated with a 
    specified file or directory into a buffer, which can then be written to the backup medium using the 
    <a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefile">WriteFile</a> function.

## -parameters

### -param hFile [in]

Handle to the file or directory to be backed up. To obtain the handle, call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea">CreateFile</a> function. The SACLs are not read unless the file handle was created with the <b>ACCESS_SYSTEM_SECURITY</b> access right. For more information, see [File security and access rights](/windows/win32/fileio/file-security-and-access-rights).

The handle must be synchronous (nonoverlapped). This means that the <b>FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED</b> flag must not be set when <a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea">CreateFile</a> is called. This function does not validate that the handle it receives is synchronous, so it does not return an error code for a synchronous handle, but calling it with an asynchronous (overlapped) handle can result in subtle errors that are very difficult to debug.

The <b>BackupRead</b> function may fail if 
      <b>CreateFile</b> was called with the flag 
      <b>FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING</b>. In this case, the 
      <a href="/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a> function returns the value 
      <b>ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER</b>.

### -param lpBuffer [out]

Pointer to a buffer that receives the data.

### -param nNumberOfBytesToRead [in]

Length of the buffer, in bytes. The buffer size must be greater than the size of a 
      <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winbase/ns-winbase-win32_stream_id">WIN32_STREAM_ID</a> structure.

### -param lpNumberOfBytesRead [out]

Pointer to a variable that receives the number of bytes read.

If the function returns a nonzero value, and the variable pointed to by 
      <i>lpNumberOfBytesRead</i> is zero, then all the data associated with the file handle has 
      been read.

### -param bAbort [in]

Indicates whether you have finished using <b>BackupRead</b> 
      on the handle. While you are backing up the file, specify this parameter as <b>FALSE</b>. 
      Once you are done using <b>BackupRead</b>, you must call 
      <b>BackupRead</b> one more time specifying 
      <b>TRUE</b> for this parameter and passing the appropriate 
      <i>lpContext</i>. <i>lpContext</i> must be passed when 
      <i>bAbort</i> is <b>TRUE</b>; all other parameters are ignored.

### -param bProcessSecurity [in]

Indicates whether the function will restore the access-control list (ACL) data for the file or directory.

If <i>bProcessSecurity</i> is <b>TRUE</b>, the ACL data will be backed 
      up.

### -param lpContext [out]

Pointer to a variable that receives a pointer to an internal data structure used by 
      <b>BackupRead</b> to maintain context information during a 
      backup operation.

You must set the variable pointed to by <i>lpContext</i> to <b>NULL</b> 
      before the first call to <b>BackupRead</b> for the specified 
      file or directory. The function allocates memory for the data structure, and then sets the variable to point to 
      that structure. You must not change <i>lpContext</i> or the variable that it points to 
      between calls to <b>BackupRead</b>.

To release the memory used by the data structure, call 
      <b>BackupRead</b> with the 
      <i>bAbort</i> parameter set to <b>TRUE</b> when the backup operation is complete.

## -returns

If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero.

If the function fails, the return value is zero, indicating that an I/O error occurred. To get extended 
       error information, call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a>.

## -remarks

This function is not intended for use in backing up files encrypted under the 
    Encrypted File System. Use 
    <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-readencryptedfileraw">ReadEncryptedFileRaw</a> for that purpose.

If an error occurs while <b>BackupRead</b> is reading data, 
    the calling process can skip the bad data by calling the 
    <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-backupseek">BackupSeek</a> function.

The file or directory should be restored using the 
    <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-backupwrite">BackupWrite</a> function.
