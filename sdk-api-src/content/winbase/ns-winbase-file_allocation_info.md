# FILE_ALLOCATION_INFO structure


## -description


Contains the total number of bytes that should be allocated for a file. This structure is used when calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-setfileinformationbyhandle">SetFileInformationByHandle</a> function.


## -struct-fields




### -field AllocationSize

The new file allocation size, in bytes. This value is typically a multiple of the sector or cluster size for the underlying physical device.


## -remarks



The end-of-file (EOF) position for a file must always be less than or equal to the file allocation size. If the allocation size is set to a value that is less than EOF, the EOF position is automatically adjusted to match the file allocation size.
