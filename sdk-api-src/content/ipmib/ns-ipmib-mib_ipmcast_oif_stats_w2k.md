# MIB_IPMCAST_OIF_STATS_W2K structure


## -description


The 
<b>MIB_IPMCAST_OIF_STATS</b> structure stores the statistics that are associated with an outgoing multicast interface.


## -struct-fields




### -field dwOutIfIndex

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Specifies the outgoing interface to which these statistics are related.


### -field dwNextHopAddr

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Specifies the address of the next hop that corresponds to <b>dwOutIfIndex</b>. The <b>dwOutIfIndex</b> and <b>dwIfNextHopIPAddr</b> members uniquely identify a next hop on point-to-multipoint interfaces, where one interface connects to multiple networks. Examples of point-to-multipoint interfaces include non-broadcast multiple-access (NBMA) interfaces, and the internal interface on which all dial-up clients connect. 




For Ethernet and other broadcast interfaces, specify zero. Also specify zero for point-to-point interfaces, which are identified by only <b>dwOutIfIndex</b>.


#### - pvDialContext

Type: <b>PVOID</b>

Reserved. This member should be <b>NULL</b>.


### -field ulTtlTooLow

Type: <b>ULONG</b>

Specifies the number of packets on this outgoing interface that were discarded because the packet's time-to-live (TTL) value was too low.


### -field ulFragNeeded

Type: <b>ULONG</b>

Specifies the number of packets that required fragmentation when they were forwarded on this interface.


### -field ulOutPackets

Type: <b>ULONG</b>

Specifies the number of packets that were forwarded out this interface.


### -field ulOutDiscards

Type: <b>ULONG</b>

Specifies the number of packets that were discarded on this interface.


## -remarks



On the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) released for Windows Server 2008and later, the organization of header files has changed. This  structure is defined in the <i>Ipmib.h</i> header file, not in the <i>Iprtrmib.h</i> header file. Note that the <i>Ipmib.h</i> header file is automatically included in <i>Iprtrmib.h</i>, which is automatically included in the <i>Iphlpapi.h</i> header file. The  <i>Ipmib.h</i> and <i>Iprtrmib.h</i> header files should never be used directly.
