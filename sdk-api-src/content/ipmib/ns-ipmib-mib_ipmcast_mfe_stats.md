# MIB_IPMCAST_MFE_STATS structure


## -description

The 
<b>MIB_IPMCAST_MFE_STATS</b> structure stores the statistics associated with a Multicast Forwarding Entry (MFE).

## -struct-fields

### -field dwGroup

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The multicast group for this MFE. A value of zero indicates a wildcard group.

### -field dwSource

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The range of source addresses for this MFE. A value of zero indicates a wildcard source.

### -field dwSrcMask

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The IPv4 subnet mask that corresponds to <b>dwSourceAddr</b>. The <b>dwSourceAddr</b> and <b>dwSourceMask</b> members are used together to define a range of sources.

### -field dwUpStrmNgbr

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The upstream neighbor that is related to this MFE.

### -field dwInIfIndex

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The index of the incoming interface to which this MFE is related.

### -field dwInIfProtocol

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The routing protocol that owns the incoming interface to which this MFE is related.

### -field dwRouteProtocol

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The client that created the route.

### -field dwRouteNetwork

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The address associated with the route referred to by <b>dwRouteProtocol</b>.

### -field dwRouteMask

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The mask associated with the route referred to by <b>dwRouteProtocol</b>.

### -field ulUpTime

Type: <b>ULONG</b>

The time, in 100ths of a seconds, since the MFE was created.

### -field ulExpiryTime

Type: <b>ULONG</b>

The time, in 100ths of a seconds, until the MFE will be deleted. A value of zero is specified if the MFE is not subject to aging requirements.

### -field ulNumOutIf

Type: <b>ULONG</b>

The number of interfaces in the outgoing interface list for this MFE.

### -field ulInPkts

Type: <b>ULONG</b>

The number of packets that have been forwarded that matched this MFE.

### -field ulInOctets

Type: <b>ULONG</b>

The number of octets of data forwarded that match this MFE.

### -field ulPktsDifferentIf

Type: <b>ULONG</b>

The number of packets matching this MFE that were dropped due to an incoming interface check.

### -field ulQueueOverflow

Type: <b>ULONG</b>

The number of packets matching this MFE that were dropped due to a queue overflow. There is one queue per MFE.

### -field rgmiosOutStats

Type: <b>MIB_IPMCAST_OIF_STATS[ANY_SIZE]</b>

A pointer to a table of outgoing interface statistics that are implemented as an array of 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/ipmib/ns-ipmib-mib_ipmcast_oif_stats_lh">MIB_IPMCAST_OIF_STATS</a> structures. The number of entries in the table is specified by the value of the <b>ulNumOutIf</b> member.

## -remarks

The 
<b>MIB_IPMCAST_MFE_STATS</b> structure does not have a fixed size. Use the <b>SIZEOF_MIB_MFE_STATS(X)</b> macro to determine the size of this structure. This macro is defined in the Iprtrmib.h header file.

The <b>dwRouteProtocol</b>, <b>dwRouteNetwork</b>, and <b>dwRouteMask</b> members uniquely identify the route to which this MFE is related.

On the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) released for Windows Vistaand later, the organization of header files has changed. This  structure is defined in the <i>Ipmib.h</i> header file, not in the <i>Iprtrmib.h</i> header file. Note that the <i>Ipmib.h</i> header file is automatically included in <i>Iprtrmib.h</i>, which is automatically included in the <i>Iphlpapi.h</i> header file. The  <i>Ipmib.h</i> and <i>Iprtrmib.h</i> header files should never be used directly.
