# Pie function


## -description


The <b>Pie</b> function draws a pie-shaped wedge bounded by the intersection of an ellipse and two radials. The pie is outlined by using the current pen and filled by using the current brush.


## -parameters




### -param hdc [in]

A handle to the device context.


### -param left [in]

The x-coordinate, in logical coordinates, of the upper-left corner of the bounding rectangle.


### -param top [in]

The y-coordinate, in logical coordinates, of the upper-left corner of the bounding rectangle.


### -param right [in]

The x-coordinate, in logical coordinates, of the lower-right corner of the bounding rectangle.


### -param bottom [in]

The y-coordinate, in logical coordinates, of the lower-right corner of the bounding rectangle.


### -param xr1 [in]

The x-coordinate, in logical coordinates, of the endpoint of the first radial.


### -param yr1 [in]

The y-coordinate, in logical coordinates, of the endpoint of the first radial.


### -param xr2 [in]

The x-coordinate, in logical coordinates, of the endpoint of the second radial.


### -param yr2 [in]

The y-coordinate, in logical coordinates, of the endpoint of the second radial.


## -returns



If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero.

If the function fails, the return value is zero.




## -remarks



The curve of the pie is defined by an ellipse that fits the specified bounding rectangle. The curve begins at the point where the ellipse intersects the first radial and extends counterclockwise to the point where the ellipse intersects the second radial.

The current position is neither used nor updated by the <b>Pie</b> function.
