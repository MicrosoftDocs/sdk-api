## -description



The <b>COLORADJUSTMENT</b> structure defines the color adjustment values used by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-stretchblt">StretchBlt</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-stretchdibits">StretchDIBits</a> functions when the stretch mode is HALFTONE. You can set the color adjustment values by calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-setcoloradjustment">SetColorAdjustment</a> function.




## -struct-fields




### -field caSize

The size, in bytes, of the structure.


### -field caFlags

Specifies how the output image should be prepared. This member may be set to <b>NULL</b> or any combination of the following values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CA_NEGATIVE</td>
<td>Specifies that the negative of the original image should be displayed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CA_LOG_FILTER</td>
