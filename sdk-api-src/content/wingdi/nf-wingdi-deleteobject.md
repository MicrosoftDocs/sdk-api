# DeleteObject function


## -description


The <b>DeleteObject</b> function deletes a logical pen, brush, font, bitmap, region, or palette, freeing all system resources associated with the object. After the object is deleted, the specified handle is no longer valid.


## -parameters




### -param ho [in]

A handle to a logical pen, brush, font, bitmap, region, or palette.


## -returns



If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero.

If the specified handle is not valid or is currently selected into a DC, the return value is zero.




## -remarks



Do not delete a drawing object (pen or brush) while it is still selected into a DC.

When a pattern brush is deleted, the bitmap associated with the brush is not deleted. The bitmap must be deleted independently.
