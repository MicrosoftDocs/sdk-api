# WidenPath function


## -description


The <b>WidenPath</b> function redefines the current path as the area that would be painted if the path were stroked using the pen currently selected into the given device context.


## -parameters




### -param hdc [in]

A handle to a device context that contains a closed path.


## -returns



If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero.

If the function fails, the return value is zero.




## -remarks



The <b>WidenPath</b> function is successful only if the current pen is a geometric pen created by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-extcreatepen">ExtCreatePen</a> function, or if the pen is created with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-createpen">CreatePen</a> function and has a width, in device units, of more than one.

The device context identified by the <i>hdc</i> parameter must contain a closed path.

Any Bézier curves in the path are converted to sequences of straight lines approximating the widened curves. As such, no Bézier curves remain in the path after <b>WidenPath</b> is called.
