# METAFILEPICT structure


## -description


Defines the metafile picture format used for exchanging metafile data through the clipboard. 


## -struct-fields




### -field mm

Type: <b>LONG</b>

The mapping mode in which the picture is drawn. 


### -field xExt

Type: <b>LONG</b>

The size of the metafile picture for all modes except the <b>MM_ISOTROPIC</b> and <b>MM_ANISOTROPIC</b> modes. (For more information about these modes, see the <b>yExt</b> member.) The x-extent specifies the width of the rectangle within which the picture is drawn. The coordinates are in units that correspond to the mapping mode. 


### -field yExt

Type: <b>LONG</b>

The size of the metafile picture for all modes except the <b>MM_ISOTROPIC</b> and <b>MM_ANISOTROPIC</b> modes. The y-extent specifies the height of the rectangle within which the picture is drawn. The coordinates are in units that correspond to the mapping mode. For <b>MM_ISOTROPIC</b> and <b>MM_ANISOTROPIC</b> modes, which can be scaled, the <b>xExt</b> and <b>yExt</b> members contain an optional suggested size in <b>MM_HIMETRIC</b> units. For <b>MM_ANISOTROPIC</b> pictures, <b>xExt</b> and <b>yExt</b> can be zero when no suggested size is supplied. For <b>MM_ISOTROPIC</b> pictures, an aspect ratio must be supplied even when no suggested size is given. (If a suggested size is given, the aspect ratio is implied by the size.) To give an aspect ratio without implying a suggested size, set <b>xExt</b> and <b>yExt</b> to negative values whose ratio is the appropriate aspect ratio. The magnitude of the negative <b>xExt</b> and <b>yExt</b> values is ignored; only the ratio is used. 


### -field hMF

Type: <b>HMETAFILE</b>

A handle to a memory metafile.
