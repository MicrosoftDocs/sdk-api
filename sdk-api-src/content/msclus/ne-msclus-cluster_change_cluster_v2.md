# CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_V2 enumeration


## -description


Defines the list of notifications that are generated for a cluster.


## -enum-fields




### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_RECONNECT_V2

Indicates that a reconnect procedure occurred. This notification applies to clients only.


### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_STATE_V2

Indicates that a cluster state changed. This notification applies to clients only.


### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_GROUP_ADDED_V2

Indicates that a new group was created.


### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_HANDLE_CLOSE_V2

Indicates that a context handle was closed. This notification applies to clients only.


### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_NETWORK_ADDED_V2

Indicates that a cluster network was added to the cluster.


### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_NODE_ADDED_V2

Indicates that a node was added to the cluster. Nodes are added to a cluster in an implementation-specific way.


### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_TYPE_ADDED_V2

Indicates that a new resource type was added to the cluster.


### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_COMMON_PROPERTY_V2

Indicates that a cluster common property changed.


### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_PRIVATE_PROPERTY_V2

Indicates that a cluster private property changed.


### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_LOST_NOTIFICATIONS_V2

Indicates that notifications might have been lost due to a transient condition on the server.


### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_RENAME_V2

Indicates that the cluster's name changed.


### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_MEMBERSHIP_V2

Indicates that the cluster's membership changed.


### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_UPGRADED_V2

Indicates that the cluster upgraded the Cluster service.

<b>Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2012:  </b>This value is not supported until Windows Server 2016.


### -field CLUSTER_CHANGE_CLUSTER_ALL_V2

Indicates all V2 cluster notifications.

<b>Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2012:  </b>The value of this constant is  4095 (0x0FFF).
