# IConnector::IsConnected


## -description



The <b>IsConnected</b> method indicates whether this connector is connected to another connector.




## -parameters




### -param pbConnected [out]

Pointer to a <b>BOOL</b> variable into which the method writes the connection state. If the state is <b>TRUE</b>, this connector is connected to another connector. If <b>FALSE</b>, this connector is unconnected.


## -returns



If the method succeeds, it returns S_OK. If it fails, possible return codes include, but are not limited to, the values shown in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_POINTER</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Pointer <i>pbConnected</i> is <b>NULL</b>.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



For a code example that calls the <b>IsConnected</b> method, see the implementation of the SelectCaptureDevice function in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/CoreAudio/device-topologies">Device Topologies</a>.
