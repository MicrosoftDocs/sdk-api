# ICredentialProviderFilter interface


## -description


Used to dynamically filter credential providers based on information available at runtime.


## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">ICredentialProviderFilter</b> interface inherits from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/33f1d79a-33fc-4ce5-a372-e08bda378332">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>ICredentialProviderFilter</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

<tr data="declared;">
<td align="left" width="37%">
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d0730f67-e4f1-42b2-823a-75b08a5c952e">UpdateRemoteCredential</a>
</td>
<td align="left" width="63%">

## -remarks



It is recommended that third party credential providers do not use this interface to filter or disable system credential providers on a desktop. If an enterprise deploys a third party credential provider and wants to disable system credential providers currently available, that is a decision that should be made by a domain administrator after careful consideration. System policies exist that enable administrators to filter out credential providers and those should be used instead of building filters directly into a third party credential provider.
