# IWPCProviderState::Disable


## -description

Notifies the third-party application that it is not the current provider.



## -returns

If the method succeeds, the function returns <b>S_OK</b>.

If the method fails, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value that indicates the error. For a list of common error codes, see <a href="/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/common-hresult-values">Common HRESULT Values</a>.

## -remarks

This method is called for every registered provider when the current provider changes. This means that the <b>Disable</b> method may be called for a provider that has already been disabled.
