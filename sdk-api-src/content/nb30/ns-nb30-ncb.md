# NCB structure


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/netbios/portal">Netbios</a> is not supported on Windows Vista,  Windows Server 2008, and subsequent versions of the operating system]

The <b>NCB</b> structure represents a network control block. It contains information about the command to perform, an optional post routine, an optional event handle, and a pointer to a buffer that is used for messages or other data. A pointer to this structure is passed to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/nb30/nf-nb30-netbios">Netbios</a> function. 




## -struct-fields




### -field ncb_command

Specifies the command code and a flag that indicates whether the <b>NCB</b> structure is processed asynchronously. The most significant bit contains the flag. If the ASYNCH constant is combined with a command code (by using the OR operator), the <b>NCB</b> structure is processed asynchronously. The following command codes are supported.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Code</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NCBACTION</td>
<td>

<b>Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, Windows 2000, and Windows NT:  </b>Enables extensions to the transport interface. NCBACTION is mapped to <b>TdiAction</b>. When this code is specified, the <b>ncb_buffer</b> member points to a buffer to be filled with an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/nb30/ns-nb30-action_header">ACTION_HEADER</a> structure, which is optionally followed by data. NCBACTION commands cannot be canceled by using NCBCANCEL. 
NCBACTION is not a standard NetBIOS 3.0 command.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NCBADDGRNAME  
</td>

<td>
Adds a unique name to the local name table. The TDI driver ensures that the name is unique across the network.

</td>
</tr>

### -field ncb_lsn

Identifies the local session number. This number uniquely identifies a session within an environment. This number is returned by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/nb30/nf-nb30-netbios">Netbios</a> function after a successful NCBCALL command. 


### -field ncb_num

Specifies the number for the local network name. This number is returned by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/nb30/nf-nb30-netbios">Netbios</a> after a successful <b>NCBADDNAME</b> or <b>NCBADDGRNAME</b> command. This number, not the name, must be used with all datagram commands and for <b>NCBRECVANY</b> commands.

The number for <b>NAME_NUMBER_1</b> is always 0x01. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/nb30/nf-nb30-netbios">Netbios</a> function assigns values in the range 0x02 to 0xFE for the remaining names.


### -field ncb_buffer

Pointer to the message buffer. The buffer must have write access. Its uses are as follows:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Command</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NCBSEND</td>
<td>Contains the message to be sent. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NCBRECV</td>
<td>Receives the message. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NCBSSTAT</td>
<td>Receives the requested status information.</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field ncb_length

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the message buffer. For receive commands, this member is set by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/nb30/nf-nb30-netbios">Netbios</a> function to indicate the number of bytes received.

If the buffer length is incorrect, the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/nb30/nf-nb30-netbios">Netbios</a> function returns the <b>NRC_BUFLEN</b> error code.


### -field ncb_callname

Specifies the name of the remote application. Trailing-space characters should be supplied to make the length of the string equal to <b>NCBNAMSZ</b>. 



### -field ncb_name

Specifies the name by which the application is known. Trailing-space characters should be supplied to make the length of the string equal to <b>NCBNAMSZ</b>. 



### -field ncb_rto

Specifies the time-out period for receive operations, in 500-millisecond units, for the session. A value of zero implies no time-out. Specify with the <b>NCBCALL</b> or <b>NCBLISTEN</b> command. Affects subsequent <b>NCBRECV</b> commands. 



### -field ncb_sto

Specifies the time-out period for send operations, in 500-millisecond units, for the session. A value of zero implies no time-out. Specify with the <b>NCBCALL</b> or <b>NCBLISTEN</b> command. Affects subsequent <b>NCBSEND</b> and <b>NCBCHAINSEND</b> commands. 



### -field ncb_post

Specifies the address of the post routine to call when the asynchronous command is completed. The post routine is defined as:

  NCB_POST PostRoutine( PNCB <i>pncb</i> );

where the <i>pncb</i> parameter is a pointer to the completed <b>NCB</b> structure. 




### -field ncb_lana_num

Specifies the LAN adapter number. This zero-based number corresponds to a particular transport provider using a particular LAN adapter board.


### -field ncb_cmd_cplt

Specifies the command complete flag. This value is the same as the <b>ncb_retcode</b> member.


### -field ncb_reserve

Reserved; must be zero.

The length, X,  of the <b>ncb_reserve</b>  array is dependent upon the system architecture. For 64-bit systems, the  array contains 18 elements. Otherwise, the array contains 10 elements.


### -field ncb_event

Specifies a handle to an event object that is set to the nonsignaled state when an asynchronous command is accepted, and it is set to the signaled state when the asynchronous command is completed. The event is signaled if the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/nb30/nf-nb30-netbios">Netbios</a> function returns a nonzero value. Only manual reset events should be used for synchronization. A specified event should not be associated with more than one active asynchronous command.

The <b>ncb_event</b> member must be zero if the <b>ncb_command</b> member does not have the <b>ASYNCH</b> flag set or if <b>ncb_post</b> is nonzero. Otherwise, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/nb30/nf-nb30-netbios">Netbios</a> returns the <b>NRC_ILLCMD</b> error code.


## -remarks



Using <b>ncb_event</b> to issue asynchronous requests requires fewer system resources than using <b>ncb_post</b>. In addition, when <b>ncb_event</b> is nonzero, the pending request is canceled if the thread terminates before the request is processed. This is not true for asynchronous requests sent using <b>ncb_post</b>.
