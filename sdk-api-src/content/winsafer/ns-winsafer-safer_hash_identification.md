# SAFER_HASH_IDENTIFICATION structure


## -description


The <b>SAFER_HASH_IDENTIFICATION</b> structure represents a hash identification rule.


## -struct-fields




### -field header

A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winsafer/ns-winsafer-safer_identification_header">SAFER_IDENTIFICATION_HEADER</a> structure containing the structure header. The <b>dwIdentificationType</b> member  of the header must be <b>SaferIdentityTypeImageHash</b>, and the <b>cbStructSize</b> member  of the header must be sizeof(SAFER_HASH_IDENTIFICATION).


### -field Description

A description of the hash identification rule provided by the user.


### -field FriendlyName

A human-readable name for the hash identification rule. 


### -field HashSize

The size of the <b>ImageHash</b> member in bytes. For example, if the algorithm specified by the <b>HashAlgorithm</b> member is MD5, the size is 16.


### -field ImageHash

The computed hash of the code image.


### -field HashAlgorithm

The algorithm used to compute the hash.


### -field ImageSize

The size of the original file in bytes.


### -field dwSaferFlags

Reserved for future use.
