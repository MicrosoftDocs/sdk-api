## -description

Disassociates a specified color profile with a specified device on a specified computer.

> [!NOTE] 
> This API does not support "advanced color" profiles for HDR monitors. Use [**ColorProfileRemoveDisplayAssociation**](nf-icm-colorprofileremovedisplayassociation.md) for managing advanced color profiles.

## -parameters

### -param pMachineName

Reserved. Must be **NULL**. This parameter is intended to point to the name of the computer on which to disassociate the specified profile and device. A **NULL** pointer indicates the local computer.

### -param pProfileName

Pointer to the file name of the profile to disassociate.

### -param pDeviceName

Pointer to the name of the device to disassociate.

## -returns

If this function succeeds, the return value is **TRUE**.

If this function fails, the return value is **FALSE**. For extended error information, call **GetLastError**.

## -remarks

If more than one profile is associated with a device, WCS uses the last one associated as the default. That is, if your application sequentially associates three profiles with a device, WCS will use the last one associated as the default. If your application then calls the **DisassociateColorProfileFromDevice** function to disassociate the third profile (which is the default in this example), the WCS will use the second profile as the default.

If your application disassociates all profiles from a device, WCS uses the sRGB profile as the default.

**DisassociateColorProfileFromDevice** always removes the specified profile from the current user's per-user profile association list for the specified device. Before removing the profile from the list, **DisassociateColorProfileFromDevice** determines whether the user has previously expressed the desire to use a per-user profile association list for the device. If so, then **DisassociateColorProfileFromDevice** simply removes the specified profile from the existing per-user profile association list for the device. If not, then **DisassociateColorProfileFromDevice** creates a new per-user profile association list for the device by copying the system-wide association list for that device. It then removes the specified profile from the per-user list. From that point on, the current user will be using a per-user profile association list for the specified device, as if [**WcsSetUsePerUserProfiles**](/windows/win32/api/icm/nf-icm-wcssetuseperuserprofiles) had been called for *pDevice* with the *usePerUserProfiles* parameter set to **TRUE**.
