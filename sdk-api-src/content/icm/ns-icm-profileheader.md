## -description

Contains information that describes the contents of a device profile file. This header occurs at the beginning of a device profile file.

## -struct-fields

### -field phSize

The size of the profile in bytes.

### -field phCMMType

The identification number of the CMM that is used in the profile. Identification numbers are registered with the ICC.

### -field phVersion

The version number of the profile. The version number is determined by the ICC. The current major version number is 02h. The current minor version number is 10h. The major and minor version numbers are in binary coded decimal (BCD). They must be stored in the following format.

| Byte Number | Contents                                                                                                                  |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0           | Major version number in BCD.                                                                                              |
| 1           | Minor version number in the most significant nibble of this byte. Bug fix version number in the least significant nibble. |
| 2           | Reserved. Must be set to 0.                                                                                               |

### -field phClass

Indicates the profile class. For a description of profile classes, see [Using Device Profiles with WCS](/windows/win32/wcs/using-device-profiles-with-wcs). A profile class may have any of the following values.

| Profile Class                  | Signature         |
|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| Input Device Profile           | CLASS\_SCANNER    |
| Display Device Profile         | CLASS\_MONITOR    |
| Output Device Profile          | CLASS\_PRINTER    |
| Device Link Profile            | CLASS\_LINK       |
| Color Space Conversion Profile | CLASS\_COLORSPACE |
| Abstract Profile               | CLASS\_ABSTRACT   |
| Named Color Profile            | CLASS\_NAMED      |
| Color Appearance Model Profile | CLASS\_CAMP       |
| Color Gamut Map Model Profile  | CLASS\_GMMP       |

### -field phDataColorSpace

A signature value that indicates the color space in which the profile data is defined. The member can be any of value from the [Color Space Constants](/windows/win32/wcs/color-space-constants).

### -field phConnectionSpace

A signature value that indicates the color space in which the profile connection space (PCS) is defined. The member can be any of the following values.

| Profile Class | Signature  |
|---------------|------------|
| XYZ           | SPACE\_XYZ |
| Lab           | SPACE\_Lab |

When the **phClass** member is set to CLASS\_LINK, the PCS is taken from the **phDataColorSpace** member.

### -field phDateTime

The date and time that the profile was created.

### -field phSignature

Reserved for internal use.

### -field phPlatform

The primary platform for which the profile was created. The primary platform can be set to any of the following values.

| Platform               | Value  |
|------------------------|--------|
| Apple Computer, Inc.   | 'APPL' |
| Microsoft Corp.        | 'MSFT' |
| Silicon Graphics, Inc. | 'SGI'  |
| Sun Microsystems, Inc. | 'SUNW' |
| Taligent               | 'TGNT' |

### -field phProfileFlags

Bit flags containing hints that the CMM uses to interpret the profile data. The member can be set to the following values.

<table>

### -field phManufacturer

The identification number of the device profile manufacturer. All manufacturer identification numbers are registered with the ICC.

### -field phModel
