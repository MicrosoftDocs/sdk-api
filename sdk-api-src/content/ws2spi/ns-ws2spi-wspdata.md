## -description
The **WSPDATA** structure contains service provider information.

## -struct-fields
```C++
} WSPDATA, *LPWSPDATA;
```

### -field wVersion
Version of the Windows Sockets SPI specification that the Windows Sockets service provider expects the caller to use.

### -field wHighVersion
Highest version of the Windows Sockets SPI specification that this service provider can support (also encoded as above). Normally this will be the same as **wVersion**.

### -field szDescription
Null-terminated Unicode string into which the Windows Sockets provider copies a description of itself. The text (up to 256 characters in length) can contain any characters except control and formatting characters: the most likely use to which an SPI client will put this is to display it (possibly truncated) in a status message.
