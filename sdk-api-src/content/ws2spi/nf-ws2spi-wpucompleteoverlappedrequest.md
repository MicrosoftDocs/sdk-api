# WPUCompleteOverlappedRequest function


## -description


The 
**WPUCompleteOverlappedRequest** function performs overlapped I/O completion notification for overlapped I/O operations.
		


## -parameters




### -param s [in]

The service provider socket created by 
<a href="/windows/win32/api/ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wpucreatesockethandle">WPUCreateSocketHandle</a>.


### -param lpOverlapped [in]

A pointer to a 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaoverlapped">WSAOVERLAPPED</a> structure associated with the overlapped I/O operation whose completion is to be notified.


### -param dwError [in]

The completion status of the overlapped I/O operation whose completion is to be notified.


### -param cbTransferred [in]

The number of bytes transferred to or from client buffers (the direction of the transfer depends on the send or receive nature of the overlapped I/O operation whose completion is to be notified).


### -param lpErrno [out]

A pointer to the error code resulting from execution of this function.


## -returns



If no error occurs, 
**WPUCompleteOverlappedRequest** returns zero and notifies completion of the overlapped I/O operation according to the mechanism selected by the client (signals an event found in the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaoverlapped">WSAOVERLAPPED</a> structure referenced by <i>lpOverlapped</i> and/or queues a completion status report to the completion port associated with the socket if a completion port is associated). Otherwise, 
**WPUCompleteOverlappedRequest** returns SOCKET_ERROR, and a specific error code is available in <i>lpErrno</i>.

## -remarks



The 
**WPUCompleteOverlappedRequest** function performs overlapped I/O completion notification for overlapped I/O operations where the client-specified completion mechanism is something other than user mode–asynchronous procedure call (APC). This function can only be used for socket handles created by 
<a href="/windows/win32/api/ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wpucreatesockethandle">WPUCreateSocketHandle</a>.

<div class="alert">**Note**  This function is different from other functions with the "WPU" prefix in that it is not accessed through the upcall table. Instead, it is exported directly by Ws2_32.dll. Service providers that need to call this function should link with WS2_32.lib or use appropriate operating system functions such as <a href="/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya">LoadLibrary</a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress">GetProcAddress</a> to retrieve the function pointer.</div>
<div> </div>
The function 
**WPUCompleteOverlappedRequest** is used by service providers that do not implement Installable File System (IFS) functionality directly for the socket handles they expose. It performs completion notification for any overlapped I/O request for which the specified completion notification is other than a user-mode APC. 
**WPUCompleteOverlappedRequest** is supported only for the socket handles created by 
<a href="/windows/win32/api/ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wpucreatesockethandle">WPUCreateSocketHandle</a> and not for sockets created by a service provider directly.

If the client selects a user-mode APC as the notification method, the service provider should use 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wpuqueueapc">WPUQueueApc</a> or another appropriate operating system function to perform the completion notification. If user-mode APC is not selected by the client, a service provider that does not implement IFS functionality directly cannot determine whether or not the client has associated a completion port with the socket handle. Thus, it cannot determine whether the completion notification method should be queuing a completion status record to a completion port or signaling an event found in the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaoverlapped">WSAOVERLAPPED</a> structure. The Windows Socket 2 architecture keeps track of any completion port association with a socket created by 
<a href="/windows/win32/api/ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wpucreatesockethandle">WPUCreateSocketHandle</a> and can make a correct decision between completion port-based notification or event-based notification.

When 
**WPUCompleteOverlappedRequest** queues a completion indication, it sets the **InternalHigh** member of the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaoverlapped">WSAOVERLAPPED</a> structure to the count of bytes transferred. Then, it sets the **Internal** member to some OS-dependent value other than the special value WSS_OPERATION_IN_PROGRESS. There may be some slight delay after 
**WPUCompleteOverlappedRequest** returns before these values appear, since processing may occur asynchronously. However, the **InternalHigh** value (byte count) is guaranteed to be set by the time **Internal** is set.

**WPUCompleteOverlappedRequest** works as stated (performs the completion notification as requested by the client) whether or not the socket handle has been associated with a completion port.

**Interaction with WSPGetOverlappedResult**

The behavior of 
**WPUCompleteOverlappedRequest** places some constraints on how a service provider implements 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/nc-ws2spi-lpwspgetoverlappedresult">WSPGetOverlappedResult</a> since only the **Offset** and **OffsetHigh** members of the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaoverlapped">WSAOVERLAPPED</a> structure are exclusively controlled by the service provider, yet three values (byte count, flags, and error) must be retrieved from the structure by 
**WSPGetOverlappedResult**. A service provider may accomplish this any way it chooses as long as it interacts with the behavior of 
**WPUCompleteOverlappedRequest** properly. However, a typical implementation is as follows:

 
- At the start of overlapped processing, the service provider sets **Internal** to WSS_OPERATION_IN_PROGRESS. 
- When the I/O operation has been completed, the provider sets **OffsetHigh** to the Windows Socket 2 error code resulting from the operation, sets **Offset** to the flags resulting from the I/O operation, and calls 
**WPUCompleteOverlappedRequest**, passing the transfer byte count as one of the parameters. 
**WPUCompleteOverlappedRequest** eventually sets **InternalHigh** to the transfer byte count, then sets **Internal** to a value other than WSS_OPERATION_IN_PROGRESS. 
- When 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/nc-ws2spi-lpwspgetoverlappedresult">WSPGetOverlappedResult</a> is called, the service provider checks **Internal**. If it is WSS_OPERATION_IN_PROGRESS, the provider waits on the event handle in the **hEvent** member or returns an error, based on the setting of the FWAIT flag of 
**WSPGetOverlappedResult**. If not in progress, or after completion of waiting, the provider returns the values from **InternalHigh**, **OffsetHigh**, and **Offset** as the transfer count, operation result error code, and flags respectively.
