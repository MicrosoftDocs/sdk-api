# WPUQueueApc function


## -description

The 
**WPUQueueApc** function queues a user mode–asynchronous procedure call (APC) to the specified thread in order to facilitate invocation of overlapped I/O completion routines.

## -parameters

### -param lpThreadId [in]

Pointer to a 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/ns-ws2spi-wsathreadid">WSATHREADID</a> structure that identifies the thread context. A pointer to this structure is supplied to the service provider by the Ws2_32.dll as an input parameter to an overlapped operation. The provider should store the 
**WSATHREADID** structure locally and provide a pointer to this local store. The local copy of 
**WSATHREADID** is no longer needed once 
**WPUQueueApc** returns.

### -param lpfnUserApc [in]

Pointer to the APC function to be called.

### -param dwContext [in]

32-bit context value that is subsequently supplied as an input parameter to the APC function.

### -param lpErrno [out]

Pointer to the error code.

## -returns

If no error occurs, 
**WPUQueueApc** returns zero and queues the completion routine for the specified thread. Otherwise, it returns SOCKET_ERROR, and a specific error code is available in <i>lpErrno</i>.

## -remarks

This function queues an APC function against the specified thread. Under Windows, this will be done using a user mode–asynchronous procedure call (APC). The APC will only execute when the specified thread is blocked in an alertable wait and a callback will be made directly. This call is safe for use within an interrupt context.

LPWSAUSERAPC is defined as follows:


```cpp
typedef void ( CALLBACK FAR * LPWSAUSERAPC )( DWORD dwContext );

```


Because the APC mechanism supports only a single  context value, <i>lpfnUserApc</i> itself cannot be the client specified–completion routine, which involves more parameters. The service provider must instead supply a pointer to its own APC function that uses the supplied <i>dwContext</i> value to access the needed result information for the overlapped operation, and then invokes the client specified–completion routine.

For service providers where a user-mode component implements overlapped I/O, a typical usage of the APC mechanism is as follows.

<ol>
- When the I/O operation completes, the provider allocates a small buffer and packs it with a pointer to the client-supplied completion procedure and parameter values to pass to the procedure. 
- It queues an APC, specifying the pointer to the buffer as the <i>dwContext</i> value and its own intermediate procedure as the target procedure <i>lpfnUserApc</i>. 
- When the target thread eventually enters alertable wait state, the service provider's intermediate procedure is called in the proper thread context. 
- The intermediate procedure simply unpacks parameters, deallocates the buffer, and calls the client-supplied completion procedure. 
</ol>
