# POINTS structure


## -description


The POINTS structure defines the x- and y-coordinates of a point.


## -struct-fields




### -field y

Specifies the <i>y</i>-coordinate of the point. 


### -field x

Specifies the <i>x</i>-coordinate of the point. 


## -remarks



The POINTS structure is similar to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/windef/ns-windef-point">POINT</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/windef/ns-windef-pointl">POINTL</a> structures. The difference is that the members of the POINTS structure are of type SHORT, while those of the other two structures are of type LONG.
