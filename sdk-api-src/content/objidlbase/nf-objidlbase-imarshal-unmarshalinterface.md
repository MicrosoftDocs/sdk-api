# IMarshal::UnmarshalInterface


## -description

Unmarshals an interface pointer.

## -parameters

### -param pStm [in]

A pointer to the stream from which the interface pointer is to be unmarshaled.

### -param riid [in]

A reference to the identifier of the interface to be unmarshaled.

### -param ppv [out]

The address of pointer variable that receives the interface pointer. Upon successful return, *<i>ppv</i> contains the requested interface pointer of the interface to be unmarshaled.

## -returns

This method can return the standard return value E_FAIL, as well as the following values.

<td width="40%">

<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The interface pointer was unmarshaled successfully.

<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_NOINTERFACE</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The specified interface is not supported.

</table>

## -remarks

The COM library in the process where unmarshaling is to occur calls the proxy's implementation of this method.

<h3><a id="Notes_to_Callers"></a><a id="notes_to_callers"></a><a id="NOTES_TO_CALLERS"></a>Notes to Callers</h3>
You do not call this method directly. There are, however, some situations in which you might call it indirectly through a call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-counmarshalinterface">CoUnmarshalInterface</a>. For example, if you are implementing a stub, your implementation would call <b>CoUnmarshalInterface</b> when the stub receives an interface pointer as a parameter in a method call.

<h3><a id="Notes_to_Implementers"></a><a id="notes_to_implementers"></a><a id="NOTES_TO_IMPLEMENTERS"></a>Notes to Implementers</h3>
The proxy's implementation should read the data written to the stream by the original object's implementation of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-imarshal-marshalinterface">IMarshal::MarshalInterface</a> and use that data to initialize the proxy object whose CLSID was returned by the marshaling stub's call to the original object's implementation of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-imarshal-getunmarshalclass">IMarshal::GetUnmarshalClass</a>.

To return the appropriate interface pointer, the proxy implementation can simply call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-queryinterface(q)">QueryInterface</a> on itself, passing the <i>riid</i> and <i>ppv</i> parameters. However, your implementation of <b>UnmarshalInterface</b> is free to create a different object and, if necessary, return a pointer to it.

Just before exiting, even if exiting with an error, your implementation should reposition the seek pointer in the stream immediately after the last byte of data read.
