# SuspendThread function


## -description

Suspends the specified thread.

A 64-bit application can suspend a WOW64 thread using the <a href="/windows/win32/api/wow64apiset/nf-wow64apiset-wow64suspendthread">Wow64SuspendThread</a> function.

## -parameters

### -param hThread [in]

A handle to the thread that is to be suspended.

The handle must have the <b>THREAD_SUSPEND_RESUME</b> access right. For more information, see 
<a href="/windows/desktop/ProcThread/thread-security-and-access-rights">Thread Security and Access Rights</a>.

## -returns

If the function succeeds, the return value is the thread's previous suspend count; otherwise, it is <code>(DWORD) -1</code>. To get extended error information, use the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a> function.

## -remarks

If the function succeeds, execution of the specified thread is suspended and the thread's suspend count is incremented. Suspending a thread causes the thread to stop executing user-mode (application) code.

This function is primarily designed for use by debuggers. It is not intended to be used for thread synchronization. Calling 
<b>SuspendThread</b> on a thread that owns a synchronization object, such as a mutex or critical section, can lead to a deadlock if the calling thread tries to obtain a synchronization object owned by a suspended thread. To avoid this situation, a thread within an application that is not a debugger should signal the other thread to suspend itself. The target thread must be designed to watch for this signal and respond appropriately.

Each thread has a suspend count (with a maximum value of <b>MAXIMUM_SUSPEND_COUNT</b>). If the suspend count is greater than zero, the thread is suspended; otherwise, the thread is not suspended and is eligible for execution. Calling 
<b>SuspendThread</b> causes the target thread's suspend count to be incremented. Attempting to increment past the maximum suspend count causes an error without incrementing the count.

The 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-resumethread">ResumeThread</a> function decrements the suspend count of a suspended thread.

<b>Windows Phone 8.1:</b> This function is supported for Windows Phone Store apps on Windows Phone 8.1 and later.

<b>Windows 8.1</b> and <b>Windows Server 2012 R2</b>: This function is supported for Windows Store apps on Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and later.
