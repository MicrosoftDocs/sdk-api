# PROCESS_INFORMATION_CLASS enumeration

## -description

Indicates a specific class of process information. Values from this enumeration are passed into the [GetProcessInformation](./nf-processthreadsapi-getprocessinformation.md) and [SetProcessInformation](./nf-processthreadsapi-setprocessinformation.md) functions to specify the type of process information passed in the void pointer argument of the function call.

## -enum-fields

### -field ProcessMemoryPriority

The process information is represented by a <a href="/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/ns-processthreadsapi-memory_priority_information">MEMORY_PRIORITY_INFORMATION</a> structure. Allows applications to lower the default memory priority of threads that perform background operations or access files and data that are not expected to be accessed again soon.

### -field ProcessMemoryExhaustionInfo

The process information is represented by a <a href="/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/ns-processthreadsapi-process_memory_exhaustion_info">PROCESS_MEMORY_EXHAUSTION_INFO</a> structure. Allows applications to configure a process to terminate if an allocation fails to commit memory.

### -field ProcessAppMemoryInfo

The process information is represented by a <a href="/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/ns-processthreadsapi-app_memory_information">APP_MEMORY_INFORMATION</a> structure. Allows applications to query the commit usage and the additional commit available to this process. Does not allow the caller to actually get a commit limit.

### -field ProcessInPrivateInfo

If a process is set to **ProcessInPrivate** mode, and a trace session has set the [EVENT_ENABLE_PROPERTY_EXCLUDE_INPRIVATE](../evntrace/ns-evntrace-enable_trace_parameters.md) flag, then the trace session will drop all events from that process.

### -field ProcessPowerThrottling

The process information is represented by a <a href="/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/ns-processthreadsapi-process_power_throttling_state">PROCESS_POWER_THROTTLING_STATE</a> structure. Allows applications to configure how the system should throttle the target processâ€™s activity when managing power.

### -field ProcessReservedValue1

Reserved.

### -field ProcessTelemetryCoverageInfo

Reserved.

### -field ProcessProtectionLevelInfo

The process information is represented by a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/ns-processthreadsapi-process_protection_level_information">PROCESS_PROTECTION_LEVEL_INFORMATION</a> structure.

### -field ProcessLeapSecondInfo

The process information is represented by a <a href="../processthreadsapi/ns-processthreadsapi-process_leap_second_info.md">PROCESS_LEAP_SECOND_INFO</a> structure.

### -field ProcessMachineTypeInfo

The process is represented by a [PROCESS_MACHINE_INFORMATION](ns-processthreadsapi-process_machine_information.md) structure.

### -field ProcessInformationClassMax

The maximum value for this enumeration. This value may change in a future version.
