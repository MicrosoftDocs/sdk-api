# GetCurrentThreadStackLimits function


## -description

Retrieves the boundaries of the stack that was allocated by the system for the current thread.

## -parameters

### -param LowLimit [out]

A pointer variable that receives the lower boundary of the current thread stack.

### -param HighLimit [out]

A pointer variable that receives the upper boundary of the current thread stack.

## -remarks

    It is possible for user-mode code to execute in stack memory
         that is outside the region allocated by the system when the thread was created. Callers
         can use the <b>GetCurrentThreadStackLimits</b> function to verify that the current stack pointer is within the returned
         limits.


To compile an application that uses this function, set _WIN32_WINNT &gt;= 0x0602. For more information, see <a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/using-the-windows-headers">Using the Windows Headers</a>.
