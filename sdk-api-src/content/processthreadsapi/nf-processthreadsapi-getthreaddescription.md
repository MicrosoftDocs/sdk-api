# GetThreadDescription function


## -description

Retrieves the description that was assigned to a thread by calling [SetThreadDescription](/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-setthreaddescription).

## -parameters

### -param hThread [in]

A handle to the thread for which to retrieve the description. The handle must have THREAD_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION access.

### -param ppszThreadDescription [out]

A Unicode string that contains the description of the thread.

## -returns

If the function succeeds, the return value is the <b>HRESULT</b> that denotes a successful operation.
If the function fails, the return value is an <b>HRESULT</b> that denotes the error.

## -remarks

<b>Windows Server 2016</b>, <b>Windows 10 LTSB 2016</b> and <b>Windows 10 version 1607</b>: GetThreadDescription is only available by [Run Time Dynamic Linking](/windows/win32/dlls/using-run-time-dynamic-linking) in KernelBase.dll.

The description for a thread can change at any time. For example, a different thread can change the description of a thread of interest while you try to retrieve that description.

Thread descriptions do not need to be unique.

To free the memory for the thread description, call the [LocalFree](../winbase/nf-winbase-localfree.md) method.



#### Examples

The following example gets the description for a thread,  prints the description, and then frees the memory for the description.

```cpp
HRESULT hr = GetThreadDescription(ThreadHandle, &data);
if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
{   
    wprintf(L"%ls\n", data);
    LocalFree(data);
}
```
