# SetThreadDescription function


## -description

Assigns a description to a thread.

## -parameters

### -param hThread [in]

A handle for the thread for which you want to set the description. The handle must have THREAD_SET_LIMITED_INFORMATION access.

### -param lpThreadDescription [in]

A Unicode string that specifies the description of the thread.

## -returns

If the function succeeds, the return value is the **HRESULT** that denotes a successful operation.
If the function fails, the return value is an **HRESULT** that denotes the error.

## -remarks

The description of a thread can be set more than once; the most recently set value is used. You can retrieve the description of a thread by calling [GetThreadDescription](/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-getthreaddescription).

SetThreadDescription is only available by [Run Time Dynamic Linking](/windows/win32/dlls/using-run-time-dynamic-linking) on Windows Server 2016, 1607.

#### Examples

The following example sets the description for the current thread to `simulation_thread`.

```cpp
HRESULT hr = SetThreadDescription(GetCurrentThread(), L"simulation_thread");
if (FAILED(hr))
{
    // Call failed.
}
```
