## -description

Resolves a weak reference by returning a strong reference to the implementing object.

## -parameters

### -param objectReference

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/inspectable/nn-inspectable-iinspectable">IInspectable</a>**</b>

A strong reference to the object.

## -returns

Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

## -remarks

If you try to resolve a weak reference to a strong reference for an object that is no longer available, then <b>IWeakReference::Resolve</b> returns <b>S_OK</b>, but the <i>objectReference</i> parameter points to null.
