## -description

Represents a source object to which a weak reference can be retrieved.

> [!NOTE]
> With only a few exceptions, weak reference support is on by default for Windows Runtime types that you consume or author in [C++/WinRT](/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/), WRL, and C++/CX. **Windows.UI.Composition** and **Windows.Devices.Input.PenDevice** are examples of exceptions&mdash;that is, namespaces where weak reference support is *not* on for those types.
> 
> If you're authoring types, then see [Weak references in C++/WinRT](/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/weak-references#weak-references-in-cwinrt).

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IWeakReferenceSource</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/win32/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface.
