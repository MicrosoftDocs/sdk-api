# IBDA_IPV4Filter interface


## -description

The <b>IBDA_ IPV4Filter</b> interface is implemented on a Network Provider. The methods are called by the BDA IPSink filter in order to give the Network Provider a list of multicast Ethernet addresses being requested by an application. The Network Provider then informs all registered transport information filters (TIFs) of the new addresses. The TIF(s) are responsible for mapping those addresses to PIDs and passing the PIDs back to the Network Provider, which then resets the PID list for the IP data output pin on the MPEG-2 Demultiplexer. This causes the IP data on the specified PIDs to be routed through the data services segment of the graph and on to Winsock where the listening application can receive it. The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/bdaiface/nn-bdaiface-ibda_ethernetfilter">IBDA_EthernetFilter</a> interface performs the same function for Ethernet multicast addresses.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IBDA_IPV4Filter</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IBDA_IPV4Filter</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

To declare the interface identifier (IID) for this interface, use the <b>__uuidof</b> operator: <code>__uuidof(IBDA_ IPV4Filter)</code>.
