# IBDA_Topology interface


## -description

The <b>IBDA_Topology</b> interface is implemented on BDA device filters. A single filter may represent multiple hardware devices (called control nodes) which may be connected in various ways within the filter itself. These connections generally represent hardware paths on the card. This interface provides methods that enable a Network Provider to configure or discover the types of nodes within the filter, and how these nodes are connected. The methods correspond closely to the Ring 0 property sets which are documented in the Windows DDK.

<b>OCUR Devices: </b>This interface supports OpenCable Unidirectional Cable Receiver (OCUR) devices. See <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/mstv/ocur-devices">OCUR Devices</a>.

## -inheritance

The <b>IBDA_Topology</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IBDA_Topology</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

To declare the interface identifier (IID) for this interface, use the <b>__uuidof</b> operator: <code>__uuidof(IBDA_Topology)</code>.
