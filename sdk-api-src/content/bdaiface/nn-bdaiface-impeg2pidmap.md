# IMPEG2PIDMap interface


## -description

This interface is implemented on each output pin of the <a href="/windows/desktop/DirectShow/mpeg-2-demultiplexer">MPEG-2 Demultiplexer</a> filter (Demux) and is used in transport stream mode only. It is called by applications or other filters to associate the pin with one or more Packet IDs (PID). Once a PID has been mapped, the Demux will deliver all packets with that ID to the output pin. This interface is not exposed when the filter is playing back a file (pull-mode).

For program streams, use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nn-strmif-impeg2streamidmap">IMPEG2StreamIdMap</a> interface.

<b>OCUR Devices: </b>This interface supports OpenCable Unidirectional Cable Receiver (OCUR) devices. See <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/mstv/ocur-devices">OCUR Devices</a>.

## -inheritance

The <b>IMPEG2PIDMap</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IMPEG2PIDMap</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="/">Methods</a></li>
