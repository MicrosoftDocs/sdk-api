# _WINBIO_CALIBRATION_INFO structure


## -description


The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536427">IOCTL_BIOMETRIC_CALIBRATE</a> IOCTL returns the WINBIO_CALIBRATION_INFO structure as output.


## -struct-fields




### -field PayloadSize

The total size of the payload.  This includes the fixed length structure and any variable data at the end.


### -field WinBioHresult

The status detail of the I/O operation.  This is where WINBIO error and information codes will be passed. The following table shows possible values for this member.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Status value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
S_OK

</td>
<td>
The operation completed successfully.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
HRESULT_FROM_NT(STATUS_IO_DEVICE_ERROR)

</td>
<td>
The driver could not gather the necessary information from the device.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WINBIO_E_DEVICE_BUSY

</td>
<td>
The device is in the middle of a vendor-specific operation.  This should only be returned when the device cannot be reset, and the vendor-specific operation cannot be canceled.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field CalibrationData

A structure of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536469">WINBIO_DATA</a> that contains calibration data specific to this sensor.  This member is optional.
