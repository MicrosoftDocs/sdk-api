## -struct-fields




### -field cbSize

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The size of the structure, in bytes.


### -field hwndOwner

Type: <b>HWND</b>

A window handle to the owner of the window where the file will be displayed.


### -field iShow

Type: <b>int</b>

The show command for the window. This parameter is one of the <b>SW_</b> values detailed in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-showwindow">ShowWindow</a>.


### -field dwFlags

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Flags that determine what the file viewer displays. This member can be one or more of the following values.



#### FVSIF_CANVIEWIT

The file viewer can display the file.



#### FVSIF_NEWFAILED

The file viewer specified a new file to display, but no viewer could display the file. The file viewer should either continue to display the previous file or terminate.



#### FVSIF_NEWFILE

A drag-and-drop operation has dropped a file on the file viewer window. The file viewer passes the name of the file to the Shell by copying the name to the <b>strNewFile</b> member. The Shell attempts to load a file viewer that can display the new file.



#### FVSIF_PINNED

A pinned window exists. A file viewer should either use the pinned window to display the file or set a new pinned window and display the file in it.



#### FVSIF_RECT

The <b>rect</b> member contains valid data.


### -field rect

The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/windef/ns-windef-rect">RECT</a> structure that specifies the size and position of the file viewer's window. This member is valid only if the <b>dwFlags</b> member includes the <b>FVSIF_RECT</b> value.


### -field punkRel

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a>*</b>

The address of an interface that has its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-release">Release</a> method called by a new file viewer to release the previous file viewer. This member is used when a drag-and-drop operation drops a file on the file viewer's window.


### -field strNewFile

Type: <b>OLECHAR[MAX_PATH]</b>

The address of a string that specifies the name of a new file to display. A file viewer sets this member when a drag-and-drop operation drops a file on the file viewer's window.
