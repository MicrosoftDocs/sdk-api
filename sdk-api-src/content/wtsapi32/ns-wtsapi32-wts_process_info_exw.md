# WTS_PROCESS_INFO_EXW structure


## -description

Contains extended information about a process running on a Remote Desktop Session Host (RD Session Host) server. This structure is returned by the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wtsapi32/nf-wtsapi32-wtsenumerateprocessesexa">WTSEnumerateProcessesEx</a> function when you set the <i>pLevel</i> parameter to one.

## -struct-fields

### -field SessionId

The Remote Desktop Services session identifier for the session associated with the process.

### -field ProcessId

The process identifier that uniquely identifies the process on the RD Session Host server.

### -field pProcessName

A pointer to a null-terminated string that contains the name of the executable file associated with the process.

### -field pUserSid

A pointer to the user security identifiers (SIDs) in the primary access token of the process. For more 
      information about SIDs and access tokens, see 
      <a href="/windows/desktop/SecAuthZ/access-control">Access Control</a> and 
      <a href="/windows/desktop/SecAuthZ/security-identifiers">Security Identifiers</a>.

### -field NumberOfThreads

The number of threads in the process.

### -field HandleCount

The number of handles in the process.

### -field PagefileUsage

The page file usage of the process, in bytes.

### -field PeakPagefileUsage

## -remarks

> [!NOTE]
> The wtsapi32.h header defines WTS_PROCESS_INFO_EX as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
