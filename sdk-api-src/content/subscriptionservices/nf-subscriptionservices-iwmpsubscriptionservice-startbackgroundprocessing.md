# IWMPSubscriptionService::startBackgroundProcessing


## -description



<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This section describes functionality designed for use by online stores. Use of this functionality outside the context of an online store is not supported.</div>
<div> </div>
The <b>startBackgroundProcessing</b> method is implemented by the online store to initiate background processing tasks.




## -parameters




### -param hwnd [in]

A handle to a window in which the plug-in can display a user interface.


## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>.




## -remarks



Your code should not perform lengthy operations synchronously when Windows Media Player calls this method. Instead, you must perform time-consuming tasks on a separate worker thread.

Windows Media Player calls <b>startBackgroundProcessing</b> during idle time after the user selects the online store. This is useful for the online store to acquire play count data or renew expired licenses.
