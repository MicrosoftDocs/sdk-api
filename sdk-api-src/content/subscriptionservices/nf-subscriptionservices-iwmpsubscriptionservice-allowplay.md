# IWMPSubscriptionService::allowPlay


## -description

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This section describes functionality designed for use by online stores. Use of this functionality outside the context of an online store is not supported.</div>
<div> </div>
The <b>allowPlay</b> method is implemented by the online store's plug-in to manage permission for Windows Media Player to play content.

## -parameters

### -param hwnd [in]

A handle to a window in which the plug-in can display a user interface.

### -param pMedia [in]

Pointer to the media object Windows Media Player is attempting to play.

### -param pfAllowPlay [out]

Pointer to a <b>BOOL</b>. If <b>true</b>, playback is allowed.

## -returns

The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>.

## -remarks

Your code should not perform lengthy operations synchronously when Windows Media Player calls this method. Instead, you must perform time-consuming tasks on a separate worker thread.

Windows Media Player calls <b>allowPlay</b> before opening the digital media file. This gives the online store an opportunity to disallow playback of licensed content or to initiate download of a new license if the license has expired.

Because the digital media file is not open when Windows Media Player calls <b>allowPlay</b>, calling certain methods on <i>pMedia</i> may not work. For instance, attempting to retrieve metadata using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wmp/nf-wmp-iwmpmedia-getiteminfo">IWMPMedia::getItemInfo</a> could fail.

The <b>allowPlay</b> method does not circumvent DRM. If the method returns <b>TRUE</b> and the license to play has not been renewed, Windows Media Player will not play the content.

The <b>allowPlay</b> method is not called when streaming protected content for which the user does not have a license.
