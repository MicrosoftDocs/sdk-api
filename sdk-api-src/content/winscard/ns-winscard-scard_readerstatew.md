# SCARD_READERSTATEW structure


## -description

The <b>SCARD_READERSTATE</b> structure is used by functions for tracking <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly">smart cards</a> within <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/r-gly">readers</a>.

## -struct-fields

### -field szReader

A pointer to the name of the reader being monitored.

Set the value of this member to "\\\\?PnP?\\Notification" and the values of all other members to zero to be notified of the arrival of a new smart card reader.

### -field pvUserData

Not used by the <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly">smart card subsystem</a>. This member is used by the application.

### -field dwCurrentState

Current <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly">state</a> of the reader, as seen by the application. This field can take on any of the following values, in combination, as a bitmask. 




					

<table>

<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>

<td width="40%"><a id="SCARD_STATE_UNAWARE"></a><a id="scard_state_unaware"></a><dl>
<dt><b>SCARD_STATE_UNAWARE</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The application is unaware of the current <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly">state</a>, and would like to know. The use of this value results in an immediate return from state transition monitoring services. This is represented by all bits set to zero.

</td>

<dt><b>SCARD_STATE_IGNORE</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The application is not interested in this reader, and it should not be considered during monitoring operations. If this bit value is set, all other bits are ignored.

</td>

<dt><b>SCARD_STATE_UNAVAILABLE</b></dt>

<dt><b>SCARD_STATE_ATRMATCH</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The application expects that there is a card in the reader with an ATR that matches one of the target cards. If this bit is set, SCARD_STATE_PRESENT is assumed. This bit has no meaning to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winscard/nf-winscard-scardgetstatuschangea">SCardGetStatusChange</a> beyond SCARD_STATE_PRESENT.

<dt><b>SCARD_STATE_EXCLUSIVE</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The application expects that the card in the reader is allocated for exclusive use by another application. If this bit is set, SCARD_STATE_PRESENT is assumed.

</td>

<dt><b>SCARD_STATE_INUSE</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The application expects that the card in the reader is in use by one or more other applications, but may be connected to in shared mode. If this bit is set, SCARD_STATE_PRESENT is assumed.

</td>

<dt><b>SCARD_STATE_MUTE</b></dt>

<td width="60%">
This implies that the card in the reader has not been powered up.

</td>

### -field dwEventState

Current <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly">state</a> of the <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/r-gly">reader</a>, as known by the <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly">smart card </a><a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/r-gly">resource manager</a>.

## -remarks

> [!NOTE]
> The winscard.h header defines SCARD_READERSTATE as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
