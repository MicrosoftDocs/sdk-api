## -description

Represents a reference to a font face. A uniquely identifying reference to a font, from which you can create a font face to query font metrics and use for rendering. A font face reference consists of a font file, font face index, and font face simulation. The file data may or may not be physically present on the local machine yet. **IDWriteFontFaceReference1** adds new facilities, including support for [IDWriteFontFace5](/windows/win32/api/dwrite_3/nn-dwrite_3-idwritefontface5).

This interface extends [IDWriteFontFaceReference](/windows/win32/api/dwrite_3/nn-dwrite_3-idwritefontfacereference).
