Creates a font resource, given a font file and a face index.

## -parameters

### -param fontFile

Type: **[IDWriteFontFile](/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritefontfile)\***

A user-provided font file representing the font face.

### -param faceIndex

Type: **[UINT32](/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types)**

The zero-based index of a font face in cases when the font file contains a collection of font faces. If the font file contains a single face, then set this value to zero.

### -param fontResource

Type: **[IDWriteFontResource](/windows/win32/api/dwrite_3/nn-dwrite_3-idwritefontresource)\*\***

The address of a pointer to an [IDWriteFontResource](/windows/win32/api/dwrite_3/nn-dwrite_3-idwritefontresource) interface. On successful completion, the function sets the pointer to a newly created font resource object, otherwise it sets the pointer to `nullptr`.

## -returns

Type: **[HRESULT](/windows/win32/com/structure-of-com-error-codes)**

If the function succeeds, it returns **S_OK**. Otherwise, it returns an [**HRESULT**](/windows/win32/com/structure-of-com-error-codes) [error code](/windows/win32/com/com-error-codes-10).
