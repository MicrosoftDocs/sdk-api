# IDWriteFactory3::CreateGlyphRunAnalysis


## -description


Creates a glyph-run-analysis object that encapsulates info that <a href="/windows/win32/DirectWrite/direct-write-portal">DirectWrite</a> uses to render a glyph run.
        


## -parameters




### -param glyphRun [in]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/ns-dwrite-dwrite_glyph_run">DWRITE_GLYPH_RUN</a></b>

A <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/ns-dwrite-dwrite_glyph_run">DWRITE_GLYPH_RUN</a> structure that contains the properties of the glyph run.
          


### -param transform [in, optional]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/ns-dwrite-dwrite_matrix">DWRITE_MATRIX</a></b>

A <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/ns-dwrite-dwrite_matrix">DWRITE_MATRIX</a> structure that describes the optional transform to be applied to glyphs and their positions. 


### -param renderingMode

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite_3/ne-dwrite_3-dwrite_rendering_mode1">DWRITE_RENDERING_MODE1</a></b>

A <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite_3/ne-dwrite_3-dwrite_rendering_mode1">DWRITE_RENDERING_MODE1</a>-typed value that specifies the rendering mode, which must be one of the raster rendering modes (that is, not default and not outline).
          


### -param measuringMode

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dcommon/ne-dcommon-dwrite_measuring_mode">DWRITE_MEASURING_MODE</a></b>

A <a href="/windows/win32/api/dcommon/ne-dcommon-dwrite_measuring_mode">DWRITE_MEASURING_MODE</a>-typed value that specifies the measuring method for glyphs in the run. This method uses this value with the other properties to determine the rendering mode.
          


### -param gridFitMode

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite_2/ne-dwrite_2-dwrite_grid_fit_mode">DWRITE_GRID_FIT_MODE</a></b>

A <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite_2/ne-dwrite_2-dwrite_grid_fit_mode">DWRITE_GRID_FIT_MODE</a>-typed value that specifies how to grid-fit glyph outlines. This value must be non-default.
          


### -param antialiasMode

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite_1/ne-dwrite_1-dwrite_text_antialias_mode">DWRITE_TEXT_ANTIALIAS_MODE</a></b>

A <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite_1/ne-dwrite_1-dwrite_text_antialias_mode">DWRITE_TEXT_ANTIALIAS_MODE</a>-typed value that specifies the type of antialiasing to use for text when the rendering mode calls for antialiasing.
          


### -param baselineOriginX

Type: <b>FLOAT</b>

The horizontal position of the baseline origin, in DIPs, relative to the upper-left corner of the DIB.
          


### -param baselineOriginY

Type: <b>FLOAT</b>

The vertical position of the baseline origin, in DIPs, relative to the upper-left corner of the DIB.
          


### -param glyphRunAnalysis [out]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwriteglyphrunanalysis">IDWriteGlyphRunAnalysis</a>**</b>

A pointer to a memory block that receives a pointer to a <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwriteglyphrunanalysis">IDWriteGlyphRunAnalysis</a> interface for the newly created glyph-run-analysis object.
          


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.
