# IDWriteFontDownloadQueue::BeginDownload


## -description


Begins an asynchronous download operation. The download operation executes   
    in the background until it completes or is cancelled by a <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite_3/nf-dwrite_3-idwritefontdownloadqueue-canceldownload">CancelDownload</a> call.


## -parameters




### -param context [in, optional]

Type: <b>IUnknown*</b>

Optional context object that is passed back to the     
          download notification handler's DownloadCompleted method. If the context object  
          implements IDWriteFontDownloadListener, its DownloadCompleted will be called    
          when done.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

 Returns S_OK if a download was successfully begun, S_FALSE if the queue was 
          empty, or a standard HRESULT error code.




## -remarks



BeginDownload removes all download requests from the queue, transferring them   
      to a background download operation. If any previous downloads are still ongoing     
      when BeginDownload is called again, the new download does not complete until     
      the previous downloads have finished.
