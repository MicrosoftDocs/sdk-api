# DWRITE_LOCALITY enumeration


## -description


Specifies the location of a resource.


## -enum-fields




### -field DWRITE_LOCALITY_REMOTE

The resource is remote, and information about it is unknown, including the file size and date. If you attempt to create a font or file stream, the creation will fail until locality becomes at least partial. 


### -field DWRITE_LOCALITY_PARTIAL

The resource is partially local, which means you can query the size and date of the file stream. With this type, you also might be able to create a font face and retrieve the particular glyphs for metrics and drawing, but not all the glyphs will be present.


### -field DWRITE_LOCALITY_LOCAL

The resource is completely local, and all font functions can be called without concern of missing data or errors related to network connectivity.
