# IDWriteFontList1::GetFontLocality


## -description

Gets the current location of a font given its zero-based index.

## -parameters

### -param listIndex [in]

Type: <b>UINT32</b>

Zero-based index of the font in the font list.

## -returns

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite_3/ne-dwrite_3-dwrite_locality">DWRITE_LOCALITY</a></b>

Returns a <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite_3/ne-dwrite_3-dwrite_locality">DWRITE_LOCALITY</a>-typed value that specifies the location of the specified font.

## -remarks

For fully local files, the result will always be <b>DWRITE_LOCALITY_LOCAL</b>. For streamed files, the result depends on how much of the file has been downloaded. <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite_3/nf-dwrite_3-idwritefontlist1-getfont">GetFont</a> fails if the locality is <b>DWRITE_LOCALITY_REMOTE</b> and potentially fails if <b>DWRITE_LOCALITY_PARTIAL</b>.
