# DWRITE_FONT_PROPERTY structure


## -description

Font property used for filtering font sets and
      building a font set with explicit properties.

## -struct-fields

### -field propertyId

Specifies the requested font property, such as DWRITE_FONT_PROPERTY_ID_FAMILY_NAME.

### -field propertyValue

Specifies the value, such as "Segoe UI".

### -field localeName

Specifies the locale to use, such as "en-US". Simply leave this empty when used
          with the font set filtering functions, as they will find a match regardless of
          language. For passing to AddFontFaceReference, the localeName specifies the language
          of the property value.
