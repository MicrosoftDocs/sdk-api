## -description

This interface encapsulates a set of fonts, such as the set of fonts installed on the system, or the set of fonts in a particular directory. The font collection API can be used to discover what font families and fonts are available, and to obtain some metadata about the fonts. **IDWriteFontCollection2** adds new facilities, including support for [IDWriteFontSet1](/windows/win32/api/dwrite_3/nn-dwrite_3-idwritefontset1).

This interface extends [IDWriteFontCollection1](/windows/win32/api/dwrite_3/nn-dwrite_3-idwritefontcollection1).
