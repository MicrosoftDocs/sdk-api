# IDWriteFontFaceReference::GetLocality


## -description

Get the locality of this font face reference.



## -returns

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite_3/ne-dwrite_3-dwrite_locality">DWRITE_LOCALITY</a></b>

Returns the locality of this font face reference.

## -remarks

You can always successfully  
     create a font face from a fully local font. Attempting to create a font     
     face on a remote or partially local font may fail with DWRITE_E_REMOTEFONT.    
     This function may change between calls depending on background downloads    
     and whether cached data expires.
