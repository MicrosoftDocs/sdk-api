# DWRITE_GLYPH_IMAGE_DATA structure


## -description


Data for a single glyph from GetGlyphImageData.


## -struct-fields




### -field imageData

Pointer to the glyph data.


### -field imageDataSize

Size of glyph data in bytes.


### -field uniqueDataId

Unique identifier for the glyph data. Clients may use this to cache a parsed/decompressed version and tell whether a repeated call to the same font returns the same data.


### -field pixelsPerEm

Pixels per em of the returned data. For non-scalable raster data (PNG/TIFF/JPG), this can be larger or smaller than requested from GetGlyphImageData when there isn't an exact match.
          For scaling intermediate sizes, use: desired pixels per em * font em size / actual pixels per em.


### -field pixelSize

Size of image when the format is pixel data.


### -field horizontalLeftOrigin

Left origin along the horizontal Roman baseline.


### -field horizontalRightOrigin

Right origin along the horizontal Roman baseline.


### -field verticalTopOrigin

Top origin along the vertical central baseline.


### -field verticalBottomOrigin

Bottom origin along vertical central baseline.
