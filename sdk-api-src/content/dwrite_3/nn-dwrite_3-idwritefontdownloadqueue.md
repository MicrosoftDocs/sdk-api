<td align="left" width="63%">
Registers a client-defined listener object that receives download notifications.  
    All registered listener's DownloadCompleted will be called after <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite_3/nf-dwrite_3-idwritefontdownloadqueue-begindownload">BeginDownload</a>completes.

</td>
<td align="left" width="63%">
Begins an asynchronous download operation. The download operation executes   
    in the background until it completes or is cancelled by a <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite_3/nf-dwrite_3-idwritefontdownloadqueue-canceldownload">CancelDownload</a> call.

<td align="left" width="63%">
 Removes all download requests from the queue and cancels any active download    
    operations.

<td align="left" width="63%">
Gets the current generation number of the download queue, which is incremented   
    every time after a download completes, whether failed or successful. This cookie  
    value can be compared against cached data to determine if it is stale.

Determines whether the download queue is empty. Note that the queue does not
