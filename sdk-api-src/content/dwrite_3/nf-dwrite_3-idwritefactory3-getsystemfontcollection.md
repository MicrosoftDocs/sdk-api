# IDWriteFactory3::GetSystemFontCollection


## -description

Retrieves a weight/width/slope tree of system fonts.

## -parameters

### -param includeDownloadableFonts

Type: <b>BOOL</b>

Indicates whether to include cloud fonts or only locally installed fonts.

### -param fontCollection

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite_3/nn-dwrite_3-idwritefontcollection1">IDWriteFontCollection1</a>**</b>

Holds the newly created font collection object, or NULL in case of failure.

### -param checkForUpdates

Type: <b>BOOL</b>

If this parameter is TRUE, the function performs an immediate check for changes       
           to the set of system fonts. If this parameter is FALSE, the function will still detect changes if the font      
           cache service is running, but there may be some latency. For example, an application might specify TRUE if      
           it has just installed a font and wants to be sure the font collection contains that font.

## -returns

Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.
