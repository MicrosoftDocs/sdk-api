# CF_CALLBACK_REGISTRATION structure


## -description

The callbacks to be registered by the sync provider.

## -struct-fields

### -field Type

The type of callback to be registered.

### -field Callback

A pointer to the callback function.

## -remarks

This callback registration is how a sync provider communicates to the library which functions to call to execute various requests from the platform.

Note that the sync provider only needs to register implemented callbacks, and <b>CF_CALLBACK_REGISTRATION</b> should always end with <b>CF_CALLBACK_REGISTRATION_END</b>.
