# CfDisconnectSyncRoot function


## -description

Disconnects a communication channel created by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/cfapi/nf-cfapi-cfconnectsyncroot">CfConnectSyncRoot</a>.

## -parameters

### -param ConnectionKey [in]

The connection key returned from <a href="/windows/desktop/api/cfapi/nf-cfapi-cfconnectsyncroot">CfConnectSyncRoot</a> that is now used to disconnect the sync root.

## -returns

If this function succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

## -remarks

This removes the communication channel with the platform that was previously established using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/cfapi/nf-cfapi-cfconnectsyncroot">CfConnectSyncRoot</a>. 

A sync provider can still receive callbacks during the <b>CfDisconnectSyncRoot</b> call, and the provider is free to choose whether the call needs to fail or be serviced. Either choice will not cause disruptions to the sync provider.

After a call to <b>CfDisconnectSyncRoot</b> returns, the sync provider will no longer receive callbacks and the platform will fail any operation that depends on said callbacks.

A sync provider should have WRITE_DATA or WRITE_DAC access to the sync root to be disconnected or a call to  <b>CfDisconnectSyncRoot</b> will be failed with HRESULT(ERROR_CLOUD_FILE_ACCESS_DENIED). Also, if the sync root has not been previously connected, the call will be failed with invalid parameters.
