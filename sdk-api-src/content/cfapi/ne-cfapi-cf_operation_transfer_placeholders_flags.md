# CF_OPERATION_TRANSFER_PLACEHOLDERS_FLAGS enumeration

## -description

Flags to specify the behavior when transferring a placeholder file or directory.

## -enum-fields

### -field CF_OPERATION_TRANSFER_PLACEHOLDERS_FLAG_NONE:0x00000000

No transfer placeholder flags.

### -field CF_OPERATION_TRANSFER_PLACEHOLDERS_FLAG_STOP_ON_ERROR:0x00000001

Causes the API to return immediately if a placeholder transfer fails. If a transfer fails, the error code will be returned.

### -field CF_OPERATION_TRANSFER_PLACEHOLDERS_FLAG_DISABLE_ON_DEMAND_POPULATION:0x00000002

If the provider no longer wants its **CF_CALLBACK_TYPE_FETCH_PLACEHOLDERS** callback to be invoked, it should mark the placeholder directory fully populated by setting the **CF_OPERATION_TRANSFER_PLACEHOLDERS_FLAG_DISABLE_ON_DEMAND_POPULATION** flag in **CF_OPERATION_TYPE_TRANSFER_PLACEHOLDERS**. Typically, a provider should set this flag after it has already laid down all the placeholders in the directory, or if the current invocation of **CF_OPERATION_TYPE_TRANSFER_PLACEHOLDERS** is supposed to lay down all the placeholders. The provider can set this flag anytime and it would be honored by the platform if the during the current invocation of **CF_OPERATION_TYPE_TRANSFER_PLACEHOLDERS**:

1. `TransferPlaceholders.PlaceholderTotalCount` <= (Sum of Prior `TransferPlaceholders.EntriesProcessed`) + Current `TransferPlaceholders.PlaceholderCount`.
2. All current `TransferPlaceholders.PlaceholderCount` placeholders are successfully created.

For example, if a provider has to transfer ten placeholders, it could transfer and set **CF_OPERATION_TRANSFER_PLACEHOLDERS_FLAG_DISABLE_ON_DEMAND_POPULATION** in one of the following ways.

It could do this:

1. Set `TransferPlaceholders.PlaceholderTotalCount` = `5`, set `TransferPlaceholders.PlaceholderCount` = `4`, and set `Flags` to `NONE`.
2. Set `TransferPlaceholders.PlaceholderTotalCount` = `9`, set `TransferPlaceholders.PlaceholderCount` = `4`, and set `Flags` to `NONE`.
3. Set `TransferPlaceholders.PlaceholderTotalCount` = `11`, set `TransferPlaceholders.PlaceholderCount` = `2`, and set `Flags` to `NONE`.
4. Set `TransferPlaceholders.PlaceholderTotalCount` = `10`, set `TransferPlaceholders.PlaceholderCount` = `0`, and set `Flags` to `CF_OPERATION_TRANSFER_PLACEHOLDERS_FLAG_DISABLE_ON_DEMAND_POPULATION`.

Or it could do the following:

1. Set `TransferPlaceholders.PlaceholderTotalCount` = `5`, set `TransferPlaceholders.PlaceholderCount` = `4`, and set `Flags` to `NONE`.
2. Set `TransferPlaceholders.PlaceholderTotalCount` = `9`, set `TransferPlaceholders.PlaceholderCount` = `4`, and set `Flags` to `NONE`.
3. Set `TransferPlaceholders.PlaceholderTotalCount` = `10`, set `TransferPlaceholders.PlaceholderCount` = `2`, and set `Flags` to `CF_OPERATION_TRANSFER_PLACEHOLDERS_FLAG_DISABLE_ON_DEMAND_POPULATION`.
