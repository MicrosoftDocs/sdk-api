# CfSetPinState function


## -description

This sets the pin state of a placeholder, used to represent a user’s intent.  Any application (not just the sync provider) can call this function.

## -parameters

### -param FileHandle [in]

The handle of the placeholder file. The caller must have READ_DATA or WRITE_DAC access to the placeholder.

### -param PinState [in]

The pin state of the placeholder file.

### -param PinFlags [in]

The pin state flags.

### -param Overlapped [in, out, optional]

Allows the call to be performed asynchronously. See the Remarks section for more details.

## -returns

If this function succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

## -remarks

When specified and combined with an asynchronous <i>FileHandle</i>, <i>Overlapped</i> allows the platform to perform the call asynchronously.  

The caller must have initialized the overlapped structure with an event to wait on. If this returns HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_IO_PENDING), the caller can then wait using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-getoverlappedresult">GetOverlappedResult</a>. If not specified, the platform will perform the API call synchronously, regardless of how the handle was created.
