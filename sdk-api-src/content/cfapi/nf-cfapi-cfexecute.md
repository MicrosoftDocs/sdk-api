# CfExecute function


## -description

The main entry point for all connection key based placeholder operations. It is intended to be used by a sync provider to respond to various callbacks from the platform.

## -parameters

### -param OpInfo [in]

Information about an operation on a placeholder.

### -param OpParams [in, out]

Parameters of an operation on a placeholder.

## -returns

If this function succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

## -remarks

A valid call to <b>CfExecute</b> will reset the timers of all pending callback requests that belong to the same sync provider process. 


<b>CfExecute</b> takes two variable-sized arguments, i.e., <a href="/windows/desktop/api/cfapi/ns-cfapi-cf_operation_info">CF_OPERATION_INFO</a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/cfapi/ns-cfapi-cf_operation_parameters">CF_OPERATION_PARAMETERS</a>, with one identifying the operation type and the other supplying detailed operation parameters.
Both arguments start with a <b>StructSize</b> field at the beginning of the corresponding structures. Callers of <b>CfExecute</b> are responsible for accurate accounting of the structure size.
