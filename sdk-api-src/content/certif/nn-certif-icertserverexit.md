# ICertServerExit interface


## -description

The <b>ICertServerExit</b> interface is exported by the server engine and is called by exit modules.

<b>ICertServerExit</b> allows exit modules to get and enumerate elements of requests and certificates.

<b>ICertServerExit</b> is defined in Certif.h. When you create your program, however, use Certsrv.h as the include file. Certcli.dll provides the <b>ICertServerExit</b> interface. The type information for this interface is also in Certclil.dll, which is shipped with the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK).

Certificate Services interfaces support both apartment-threading and free-threading models. For better throughput, free threading is recommended.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">ICertServerExit</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oaidl/nn-oaidl-idispatch">IDispatch</a> interface. <b>ICertServerExit</b> also has these types of members:
