# ICertSrvSetup::GetHashAlgorithmList


## -description

The <b>GetHashAlgorithmList</b> method gets the list of hash algorithms supported by the specified <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">cryptographic service provider</a> (CSP) for an asymmetric signature key algorithm. This method does not change the state of the <b>CCertSrvSetup</b> object.

## -parameters

### -param bstrProviderName [in]

A string that contains the provider name. For key storage providers, this must be in the form <i>PublicKeyAlgorithmName</i>#<i>KeyStorageProviderName</i> for example "RSA#Microsoft Software Key Storage provider".

### -param pVal [out]

A pointer to a <b>VARIANT</b> array of <b>VT_BSTR</b> types, where each string represents the name of a hash algorithm supported by the CSP.
