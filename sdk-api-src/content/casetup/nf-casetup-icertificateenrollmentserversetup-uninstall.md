## -remarks



You can call this method to remove CES. However, because you cannot call the <b>UnInstall</b> method on an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/casetup/nn-casetup-icertificateenrollmentserversetup">ICertificateEnrollmentServerSetup</a> object that has already been initialized, you must create a new <b>ICertificateEnrollmentServerSetup</b> before calling <b>UnInstall</b>.

This method attempts to delete all CES-related  directories and the application pool. If it is unable to do so, it still returns S_OK, but you can check the  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/casetup/nf-casetup-icertificateenrollmentserversetup-get_errorstring">ErrorString</a> property to determine what problems the method encountered.

This function performs the following actions:

<ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
Attempts to update the security descriptor of the Deleted Objects container in Active Directory to deny access by the computer. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/casetup/nf-casetup-icertificateenrollmentserversetup-install">Install</a> Remarks section.
