# ICertificateEnrollmentPolicyServerSetup interface


## -description

The <b>ICertificateEnrollmentPolicyServerSetup</b> interface represents the Certificate Enrollment Policy (CEP) Web Service within Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS). The service enables users and computers to obtain certificate enrollment policy information even when a  computer is not a member of the domain or if a domain-joined computer is temporarily outside the security boundary of the corporate network.

A related interface, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/casetup/nn-casetup-icertificateenrollmentserversetup">ICertificateEnrollmentServerSetup</a>, represents the Certificate Enrollment Web Service (CES) and enables users and computers to enroll for and renew certificates. CEP and CES work together to provide policy-based certificate enrollment.
