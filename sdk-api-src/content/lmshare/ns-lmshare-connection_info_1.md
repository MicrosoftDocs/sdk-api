### -field coni1_num_opens

Specifies the number of files currently open as a result of the connection.


### -field coni1_num_users

Specifies the number of users on the connection.


### -field coni1_time

Specifies the number of seconds that the connection has been established.


### -field coni1_username

Pointer to a string. If the server sharing the resource is running with user-level security, the <b>coni1_username</b> member describes which user made the connection. If the server is running with share-level security, <b>coni1_username</b> describes which computer (computername) made the connection. Note that Windows does not support share-level security.

This string is Unicode if  <b>_WIN32_WINNT</b> or <b>FORCE_UNICODE</b> are defined.


### -field coni1_netname

Pointer to a string that specifies either the share name of the server's shared resource or the computername of the client. The value of this member depends on which name was specified as the <i>qualifier</i> parameter to the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/lmshare/nf-lmshare-netconnectionenum">NetConnectionEnum</a> function. The name not specified in the <i>qualifier</i> parameter to 
<b>NetConnectionEnum</b> is automatically supplied to <b>coni1_netname</b>.

This string is Unicode if  <b>_WIN32_WINNT</b> or <b>FORCE_UNICODE</b> are defined.
