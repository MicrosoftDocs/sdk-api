# IDropTargetProvider::get_DropTargetEffects


## -description


Retrieves an array of localized strings that enumerate the full set of effects that can happen when the user drops a grabbed element on this drop target as part of a drag-and-drop operation.

This property is read-only.


## -parameters


## -remarks



Some drag operations support a set of different drop effects. For example, a drag operation that is initiated with a right-click might display a menu of options for the action that occurs when the element is dropped.  To find out the set of effects that can happen when the grabbed element is dropped, a client can query the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/uiautomationcore/nf-uiautomationcore-idragprovider-get_dropeffects">DropEffects</a> property of the dragged element.  This property can contain short strings such as "move", or longer ones such as "insert into Main group".  The strings are always localized.
