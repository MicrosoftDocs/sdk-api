# IAMMultiMediaStream::OpenFile


## -description

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This interface is deprecated. New applications should not use it.</div>
<div> </div>
The <code>OpenFile</code> method opens and automatically creates a filter graph for the specified media file. If DirectShow doesn't support the file format, this method does nothing.

## -parameters

### -param pszFileName [in]

Pointer to the name of the file you want to open.

### -param dwFlags [in]

Value that modifies how the filter graph will render the specified file. This value is a combination of one or more of the following flags.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value
                </th>
<th>Description
                </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AMMSF_NOCLOCK</td>
<td>Run the stream with no clock.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AMMSF_NORENDER</td>
<td>Open the file, but do not render any streams. This flag should always be accompanied with the AMMSF_RUN flag.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AMMSF_RENDERALLSTREAMS</td>
<td>Render all streams, including those that do not have an existing media stream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AMMSF_RENDERTOEXISTING</td>
<td>Only render to existing streams.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AMMSF_RUN</td>
<td>Set the stream into the run state.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<table>

<th>Return code</th>

</table>

## -remarks

The AMMSF_RENDERALLSTREAMS flag will create default rendering filters for video and audio if they do not exist. However, these default filters cannot be accessed by the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mmstream/nf-mmstream-istreamsample-getmediastream">IStreamSample::GetMediaStream</a> method.
