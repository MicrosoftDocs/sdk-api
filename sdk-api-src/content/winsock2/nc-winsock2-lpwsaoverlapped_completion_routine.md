## -description

**LPWSAOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE** is a function pointer type. You implement a matching callback function in your app, and pass that to functions such as [WSAIoctl](./nf-winsock2-wsaioctl.md), [WSARecv](./nf-winsock2-wsarecv.md), and [WSASend](./nf-winsock2-wsasend.md), among others.

The system calls your callback function when the asynchronous input and output (I/O) operation is completed or canceled, and the calling thread is in an alertable state (by using the <a href="/windows/win32/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-sleepex">SleepEx</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-msgwaitformultipleobjectsex">MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-waitforsingleobjectex">WaitForSingleObjectEx</a>, or <a href="/windows/win32/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-waitformultipleobjectsex">WaitForMultipleObjectsEx</a> function with the <i>fAlertable</i> parameter set to <b>TRUE</b>).

## -parameters

### -param dwError

Type: IN **[DWORD](/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types)**

The I/O completion status. This parameter can be one of the <a href="/windows/win32/Debug/system-error-codes">system error codes</a>.

### -param cbTransferred

Type: IN **[DWORD](/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types)**

The number of bytes transferred. If an error occurs, this parameter is zero.

### -param lpOverlapped

Type: IN **[LPWSAOVERLAPPED](./ns-winsock2-wsaoverlapped.md)**

A pointer to the [**WSAOVERLAPPED**](./ns-winsock2-wsaoverlapped.md) structure specified by the asynchronous I/O function.

The system doesn't use the [**WSAOVERLAPPED**](./ns-winsock2-wsaoverlapped.md) structure after the completion routine is called, so the completion routine can deallocate the memory used by the overlapped structure.

### -param dwFlags

Type: IN **[DWORD](/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types)**

Flags associated with the call.

## -remarks

See [**LPOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE**](../minwinbase/nc-minwinbase-lpoverlapped_completion_routine.md).
