<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This section describes functionality designed for use by online stores. Use of this functionality outside the context of an online store is not supported.</div>
<div> </div>
The <b>DownloadTrack</b> method instructs Windows Media Player to download or not to download a particular media item.




## -parameters




### -param cookie [in]

A cookie that identifies a download session. Windows Media Player previously supplied this cookie to the content partner plug-in by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/contentpartner/nf-contentpartner-iwmpcontentpartner-download">IWMPContentPartner::Download</a>.


### -param bstrTrackURL [in]

The URL of the track to download.


### -param dwServiceTrackID [in]

The ID of the track in question.


### -param bstrDownloadParams [in]

Data that the online store wants to associate with the track in question. Windows Media Player does not interpret this data; it is meaningful only to the online store. Windows Media player passes this data back to the online store when it calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/contentpartner/nf-contentpartner-iwmpcontentpartner-downloadtrackcomplete">IWMPContentPartner::DownloadTrackComplete</a>.


### -param hrDownload [in]

An <b>HRESULT</b> that specifies whether to download the track. Any success code specifies that the Player should download the track. Any failure code specifies that the Player should not download the track.


## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">

<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



For an explanation of how the Player and the plug-in work together to download a set of tracks, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WMP/downloading-media-content">Downloading Media Content</a>.

This method must be called only after a license has been predelivered for the file. The file will be placed in the user's Music folder and automatically added to the library when downloading is complete.
