# IWMPContentPartner::GetTemplate


## -description

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This section describes functionality designed for use by online stores. Use of this functionality outside the context of an online store is not supported.</div>
<div> </div>
The <b>GetTemplate</b> method retrieves the URL of the discovery page to be displayed when the library view changes in Windows Media Player.

## -parameters

### -param task [in]

A member of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/contentpartner/ne-contentpartner-wmptasktype">WMPTaskType</a> enumeration that specifies the active task pane.

### -param location [in]

A <a href="/windows/desktop/WMP/library-location-constants">library location constant</a> that specifies the type of library view the user is currently seeing. For example, the constant g_szCPListID specifies that the user is viewing a pane that shows a particular playlist.

### -param pContext [in]

The ID of the specific item the user is currently seeing. For example, if <i>location</i> is g_szCPListID, then this parameter specifies the ID of the particular playlist that the user is seeing.

### -param clickLocation [in]

A library location constant that specifies the type of item the user has selected. For example, the constant g_szCPTrackID specifies that the user has selected a particular music track.

### -param pClickContext [in]

The ID of the particular item the user has selected. For example, if <i>clickLocation</i> is g_szCPTrackID, then this parameter specifies the ID of the particular track that the user has selected.

### -param bstrFilter [in]

The filter for the current library view. This is the text that the user entered in the Player's word wheel control.

### -param bstrViewParams [in]

Parameters, meaningful only to the online store, associated with the new library location. See Remarks.

### -param pbstrTemplateURL [out]

Pointer to a <b>BSTR</b> that receives the URL of the discovery page to display.

### -param pTemplateSize [out]

Receives a member of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/contentpartner/ne-contentpartner-wmptemplatesize">WMPTemplateSize</a> enumeration that indicates the size of the template in which the Player will display the discovery page.

## -remarks

Windows Media Player calls this method when the view changes in the <b>Library</b>, <b>Sync</b>, or <b>Burn</b> pane. The Player also calls this method when one of those three panes becomes active. The pane or view can change as a result of user navigation or as the result of a call from the discovery page.

When the discovery page calls <a href="/windows/desktop/WMP/external-changeview">External.changeView</a>, it sets the <i>ViewParams</i> parameter to whatever context it wants to associate with the new view. Windows Media Player passes that context along to the plug-in in the <i>bstrViewParams</i> parameter of <b>GetTemplate</b>.

When the discovery page calls <a href="/windows/desktop/WMP/external-changeviewonlinelist">External.changeViewOnlineList</a>, it sets the <i>Params</i> parameter to whatever context it wants to associate with the new view. Windows Media Player passes that context along to the plug-in in the <i>bstrViewParams</i> parameter of <b>GetTemplate</b>.

If the view changes as a result of user navigation, Windows Media Player sets the <i>bstrParams</i> parameter to <b>NULL</b> when it calls <b>GetTemplate</b>.

Windows Media Player calls <b>GetTemplate</b> to retrieve the URL of the discovery page that it should display in the new view. The Player also receives a <b>WMPTemplateSize</b> value that indicates what portion of the new view should be occupied by the discovery page.
