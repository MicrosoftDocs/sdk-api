### -param pwdInfo [in]

<b>BLOB</b> that contains encrypted password information.

<td width="60%">
The method succeeded.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



Certain links on a discovery page have targets that should be displayed only after the user has been authenticated. The discovery page, Windows Media Player, and the online store's plug-in use the following steps to authenticate the user and display the target webpage:

<ol>
<li>Script on a discovery page calls the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WMP/external-authenticate">External.authenticate</a> method.</li>
<li>Windows Media Player displays a dialog box to obtain a user name and password.</li>
<li>Windows Media Player calls <b>IWMPContentPartner::Authenticate</b>, which initiates the authentication attempt and returns immediately.</li>
<li>When the authentication attempt is complete, the online store's plug-in calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/contentpartner/nf-contentpartner-iwmpcontentpartnercallback-notify">IWMPContentPartnerCallback::Notify</a>, passing wmpcnAuthResult and a Boolean value that indicates whether the attempt was successful.</li>
<li>If the authentication attempt was successful, Windows Media Player calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/contentpartner/nf-contentpartner-iwmpcontentpartner-getiteminfo">IWMPContentPartner::GetItemInfo</a>, passing g_szItemInfo_AuthenticationSuccessURL, to obtain the URL of an authentication-success webpage. In this call, Windows Media Player passes the same index that the discovery page passed to the <b>External.authenticate</b> method.</li>
<li>Windows Media Player displays the authentication-success webpage.</li>
</ol>
To decrypt the information supplied in <i>userInfo</i> and <i>pwdInfo</i>, use the <b>CryptUnprotectData</b> function, which is documented in the Cryptography section of the Windows SDK. You must set the CRYPTPROTECT_UI_FORBIDDEN flag in the <i>dwFlags</i> parameter. Set the optional and reserved parameters to <b>NULL</b>.
