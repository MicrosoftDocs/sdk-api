# IWMPContentPartner::Download


## -description

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This section describes functionality designed for use by online stores. Use of this functionality outside the context of an online store is not supported.</div>
<div> </div>
The <b>Download</b> method initiates the download of a set of media items.

## -parameters

### -param pInfo [in]

Pointer to an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/contentpartner/nn-contentpartner-iwmpcontentcontainerlist">IWMPContentContainerList</a> interface that describes the content to download.

### -param cookie [in]

A cookie that represents the download request.

## -returns

The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

<table>
<tr>

</tr>
</table>

## -remarks

This method initiates the process of inspecting the container list passed in <i>pInfo</i> and then returns immediately. As the plug-in inspects the container list, it calls <a href="/windows/desktop/api/contentpartner/nf-contentpartner-iwmpcontentpartnercallback-downloadtrack">IWMPContentPartnerCallback::DownloadTrack</a> once for each track in the container list. For more information about the download procedure, see <a href="/windows/desktop/WMP/downloading-media-content">Downloading Media Content</a>.
