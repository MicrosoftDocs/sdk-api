# MODEMSETTINGS structure


## -description


Contains information about a modem's configuration.


## -struct-fields




### -field dwActualSize

The size of the data actually returned to the application, in bytes. This member may be less than the <b>dwRequiredSize</b> member if an application did not allocate enough space for the variable-length portion of the structure.


### -field dwRequiredSize

The number of bytes required for the entire 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mcx/ns-mcx-modemdevcaps">MODEMDEVCAPS</a> structure, including the variable-length portion.


### -field dwDevSpecificOffset

The offset of the provider-defined portion of the structure, in bytes relative to the beginning of the structure.


### -field dwDevSpecificSize

The size of the provider-defined portion of the structure, in bytes.


### -field dwCallSetupFailTimer

The maximum number of seconds the modem should wait, after dialing is completed, for an indication that a modem-to-modem connection has been established. If a connection is not established in this interval, the call is assumed to have failed. This member is equivalent to register S7 in Hayes® compatible modems.


### -field dwInactivityTimeout

The maximum number of seconds of inactivity allowed after a connection is established. If no data is either transmitted or received for this period of time, the call is automatically terminated. This time-out is used to avoid excessive long-distance charges or online service charges if an application unexpectedly locks up or the user leaves.


### -field dwSpeakerVolume

The volume level of the monitor speaker when the speaker is on. This member can be one of the following values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="MDMVOL_HIGH"></a><a id="mdmvol_high"></a><dl>
<dt><b>MDMVOL_HIGH</b></dt>
<dt>0x00000002</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
High volume.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="MDMVOL_LOW"></a><a id="mdmvol_low"></a><dl>
<dt><b>MDMVOL_LOW</b></dt>
<dt>0x00000000</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Low volume.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="MDMVOL_MEDIUM"></a><a id="mdmvol_medium"></a><dl>
<dt><b>MDMVOL_MEDIUM</b></dt>
<dt>0x00000001</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Medium volume.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

The 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mcx/ns-mcx-modemdevcaps">MODEMDEVCAPS</a> structure specifies the speaker volumes a modem supports. Actual volumes are hardware-specific.


### -field dwSpeakerMode

The speaker mode. This member can be one of the following values. 



<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="MDMSPKR_CALLSETUP"></a><a id="mdmspkr_callsetup"></a><dl>
<dt><b>MDMSPKR_CALLSETUP</b></dt>
<dt>0x00000008</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The speaker is on until a connection is established.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="MDMSPKR_DIAL"></a><a id="mdmspkr_dial"></a><dl>
<dt><b>MDMSPKR_DIAL</b></dt>
<dt>0x00000002</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The speaker is on until a connection is established, except that it is off while the modem is actually dialing.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<dt><b>MDMSPKR_OFF</b></dt>
<dt>0x00000001</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The speaker is always off.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<dt><b>MDMSPKR_ON</b></dt>

### -field dwPreferredModemOptions

The modem options requested by the application. The local and remote modems negotiate modem options during call setup; this member specifies the initial negotiating position of the local modem. 




The <b>dwModemOptions</b> member of the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mcx/ns-mcx-modemdevcaps">MODEMDEVCAPS</a> structure specifies the modem options supported by the local modem. For a list of modem options, see the description of the 
<b>MODEMDEVCAPS</b> structure.


### -field dwNegotiatedModemOptions

The modem options that are actually in effect. This member is filled in after a connection is established and the local and remote modems negotiate modem options. 




The <b>dwModemOptions</b> member of the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mcx/ns-mcx-modemdevcaps">MODEMDEVCAPS</a> structure specifies the modem options supported by the local modem. For a list of modem options, see the description of the 
<b>MODEMDEVCAPS</b> structure.


### -field dwNegotiatedDCERate

The DCE rate in effect. This member is filled in after a connection is established and the local and remote modems negotiate modem modulations.


### -field abVariablePortion

Optional provider-defined information.
