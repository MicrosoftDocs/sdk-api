# PDH_COUNTER_PATH_ELEMENTS_A structure


## -description

The 
<b>PDH_COUNTER_PATH_ELEMENTS</b> structure contains the components of a counter path.

## -struct-fields

### -field szMachineName

Pointer to a null-terminated string that specifies the computer name.

### -field szObjectName

Pointer to a null-terminated string that specifies the object name.

### -field szInstanceName

Pointer to a null-terminated string that specifies the instance name. Can contain a wildcard character.

### -field szParentInstance

Pointer to a null-terminated string that specifies the parent instance name. Can contain a wildcard character.

### -field dwInstanceIndex

Index used to uniquely identify duplicate instance names.

### -field szCounterName

Pointer to a null-terminated string that specifies the counter name.

## -remarks

This structure is used by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/pdh/nf-pdh-pdhmakecounterpatha">PdhMakeCounterPath</a> to create a counter path and by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/pdh/nf-pdh-pdhparsecounterpatha">PdhParseCounterPath</a> to parse a counter path.

When you allocate memory for this structure, allocate enough memory for the member strings, such as <b>szCounterName</b>, that are appended to the end of this structure.
