# ICertPropertyEnrollment::Initialize


## -description

The <b>Initialize</b> method initializes the property from the certificate request ID, the certification authority (CA) configuration string, and an optional certificate display name.

## -parameters

### -param RequestId [in]

A <b>LONG</b> variable that contains the certificate request ID. A request ID is created by the enrollment process. You can retrieve this value by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-ix509enrollment-get_requestid">RequestId</a> property on the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nn-certenroll-ix509enrollment">IX509Enrollment</a> interface.

### -param strCADnsName [in]

A <b>BSTR</b> variable that contains the Domain Name System (DNS) name of the CA. This is the first name in the <i>CADnsName\CAName</i> CA configuration string. The configuration string is typically set during the enrollment process. The DNS name can be retrieved by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-ix509enrollment-get_caconfigstring">CAConfigString</a> property and separating the  string into its constituent parts.

### -param strCAName [in]

A <b>BSTR</b> variable that contains the subject common name (CN) of the CA. This is the second name in the <i>CADnsName\CAName</i> CA configuration string. The configuration string is typically set during the enrollment process. The CN name can be retrieved by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-ix509enrollment-get_caconfigstring">CAConfigString</a> property and separating the  string into its constituent parts.

### -param strFriendlyName [in, optional]

A <b>BSTR</b> variable that contains an optional display name for the certificate. The default value is <b>NULL</b>. This value is typically set during the enrollment process. You can retrieve it by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-ix509enrollment-get_certificatefriendlyname">CertificateFriendlyName</a> property.

## -returns

If the function succeeds, the function returns <b>S_OK</b>.

If the function fails, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value that indicates the error. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.  For a list of common error codes, see <a href="/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/common-hresult-values">Common HRESULT Values</a>.

</tr>
</table>

## -remarks

The values that you can use to initialize the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nn-certenroll-icertpropertyenrollment">ICertPropertyEnrollment</a> object are set during the certificate enrollment process when the client calls the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-ix509enrollment-enroll">Enroll</a> method on the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nn-certenroll-ix509enrollment">IX509Enrollment</a> object. That is, to retrieve a request ID, call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-ix509enrollment-get_requestid">RequestId</a> property on the <b>IX509Enrollment</b> object. To retrieve a certificate display name, call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-ix509enrollment-get_certificatefriendlyname">CertificateFriendlyName</a> property. To retrieve a distinguished name and common name, call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-ix509enrollment-get_caconfigstring">CAConfigString</a> property and separate the configuration string into its constituent parts.

Call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-icertproperty-setvalueoncertificate">SetValueOnCertificate</a> method to associate the property with a certificate. You can also call the following properties to retrieve the values specified during initialization:<ul>
<li>
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-icertpropertyenrollment-get_cadnsname">CADnsName</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-icertpropertyenrollment-get_caname">CAName</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-icertpropertyenrollment-get_friendlyname">FriendlyName</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-icertpropertyenrollment-get_requestid">RequestId</a>
</li>
</ul>
