# IX509CertificateRequest::ResetForEncode


## -description

The <b>ResetForEncode</b> method restores the state of the request object to that which existed before the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-ix509certificaterequest-encode">Encode</a> method was called.



## -returns

If the function succeeds, the function returns <b>S_OK</b>.

If the function fails, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value that indicates the error. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table. For a list of common error codes, see <a href="/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/common-hresult-values">Common HRESULT Values</a>.

## -remarks

You can use this method to reconfigure (re-encode and re-sign) a certificate request in response to rejection of the request by a certification authority.  The signature and the raw data are cleared. The extensions and attributes are reset to the values they had before the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-ix509certificaterequest-encode">Encode</a> method was called, but critical extension flags are not. For a CMC request object, each nested request is also reset.

This method is typically used for a CMC key archival request when the private key is encrypted and included in the request.
