## -description

The <b>ResetForEncode</b> method restores the state of the request object to that which existed before the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-ix509certificaterequest-encode">Encode</a> method was called.

## -remarks

You can use this method to reconfigure (re-encode and re-sign) a certificate request in response to rejection of the request by a certification authority.  The signature and the raw data are cleared. The extensions and attributes are reset to the values they had before the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-ix509certificaterequest-encode">Encode</a> method was called, but critical extension flags are not. For a CMC request object, each nested request is also reset.

This method is typically used for a CMC key archival request when the private key is encrypted and included in the request.
