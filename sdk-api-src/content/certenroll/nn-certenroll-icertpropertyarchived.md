# ICertPropertyArchived interface


## -description


The <b>ICertPropertyArchived</b> interface represents a certificate property that identifies whether a certificate has been archived. Typically, a certificate is archived after being renewed, and this property is set so that archived certificates can be identified and skipped during enumeration.

This property is initialized by the enrollment process after the client requests that a certificate be renewed. If a new certificate is issued, the property is associated with the old certificate in the personal store.<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/ne-certenroll-certenroll_propertyid">CERTENROLL_PROPERTYID</a> value is XCN_CERT_ARCHIVED_PROP_ID.</div>
