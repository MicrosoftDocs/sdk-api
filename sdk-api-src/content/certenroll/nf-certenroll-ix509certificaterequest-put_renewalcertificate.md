## -description

The <b>RenewalCertificate</b> property specifies or retrieves a byte array that contains the <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/d-gly">Distinguished Encoding Rules</a> (DER) encoded certificate that is being renewed.  The DER-encoded byte array is represented by a Unicode-encoded string.

This property is read/write.

The certificate is encoded by using DER as defined by the <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/a-gly">Abstract Syntax Notation One</a> (ASN.1) standard. The encoding process creates a byte array. The byte array is returned in a  string that is either a pure binary sequence or is Unicode encoded so that it can be displayed as text.

You must initialize the request object before calling this property. You can call this property before calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-ix509certificaterequest-encode">Encode</a> method.
