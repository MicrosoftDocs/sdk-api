An <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/ne-certenroll-encodingtype">EncodingType</a> enumeration value that specifies the type of Unicode encoding applied to the input string that contains the hash.

### -param strRenewalValue [in]

A <b>BSTR</b> variable that contains the hash.

## -returns

If the function succeeds, the function returns <b>S_OK</b>.

If the function fails, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value that indicates the error. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.  For a list of common error codes, see <a href="/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/common-hresult-values">Common HRESULT Values</a>.

## -remarks

Typically this property is initialized during the enrollment process. You can retrieve the certificate used during enrollment by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-ix509enrollment-get_certificate">Certificate</a> property on the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nn-certenroll-ix509enrollment">IX509Enrollment</a> interface.

Call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-icertproperty-setvalueoncertificate">SetValueOnCertificate</a> method to associate the property with a certificate. Call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-icertpropertyrenewal-get_renewal">Renewal</a> property to retrieve the hash.
