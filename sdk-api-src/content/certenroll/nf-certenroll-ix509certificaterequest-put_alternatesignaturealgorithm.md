# IX509CertificateRequest::put_AlternateSignatureAlgorithm


## -description

The <b>AlternateSignatureAlgorithm</b> property specifies and retrieves a Boolean value that indicates whether the signature algorithm <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/o-gly">object identifier</a> (OID) for a PKCS #10 request or certificate signature is discrete or combined. A PKCS #10 object can be a stand-alone request or it can be contained in a CMC or PKCS #7 request object.

This property is read/write.

## -parameters

## -remarks

Discrete algorithms are represented by separate <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/o-gly">object identifiers</a> (OIDs) for the hashing algorithm and the signing algorithm. Examples include the following values.<table>
<tr>
<th>Discrete algorithm OID</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
XCN_OID_NIST_sha256

(2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.1)

</td>
<td>
National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST) 256-bit SHA hashing algorithm.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
XCN_OID_OIWSEC_rsaSign

(1.3.14.3.2.11)

</td>
<td>
NIST OSE Implementer Workshop Security (OIWSEC) RSA signing algorithm.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 



Combined algorithms are represented by a single OID that identifies both the hashing and the signing algorithm. Examples include the following values.<table>
<tr>
<th>Combined algorithm OID</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
XCN_OID_RSA_MD2RSA

(1.2.840.113549.1.1.2)

</td>
<td>
MD2 hashing algorithm combined with the RSA encryption algorithm from RSA Laboratories.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
XCN_OID_OIWSEC_md5RSA

(1.3.14.3.2.3)

</td>
<td>
OIWSEC MD5 hashing algorithm combined with the RSA encryption algorithm.

</tr>

If the certificate request contains nested requests and you set the <b>AlternateSignatureAlgorithm</b> property on the top level request, it is automatically propagated to all of the inner requests. You can, however, set the property manually on each of the inner objects.

For a PKCS #7 or a CMC request, this property retrieves a Boolean value for the primary signature on the inner PKCS #10 request. On input, all signer certificates are updated with the specified property value.

For a PKCS #10 request or certificate signature using the RSA public key algorithm, a property value of False (which indicates a combined OID) implies a version 1.5 signature and True (discrete OID) implies a version 2.1 signature.

You must initialize the request object before calling this property. You can call this property before calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-ix509certificaterequest-encode">Encode</a> method.
