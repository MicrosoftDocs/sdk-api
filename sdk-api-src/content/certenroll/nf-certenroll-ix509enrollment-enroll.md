# IX509Enrollment::Enroll


## -description

The <b>Enroll</b> method encodes a request, submits it to an appropriate certification authority (CA), and installs the response.



## -returns

If the function succeeds, the function returns <b>S_OK</b>.

If the function fails, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value that indicates the error. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table. For a list of common error codes, see <a href="/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/common-hresult-values">Common HRESULT Values</a>.

## -remarks

The method may create a key pair if necessary. Depending on how you initialize the enrollment object and on what properties you set, there may be no need to create a key pair. For example, if you are renewing a certificate by using an existing key, or if the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nn-certenroll-ix509privatekey">IX509PrivateKey</a> object associated with the certificate request represents an existing key, this method does not create a new key pair.

Before enrolling, you must initialize the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nn-certenroll-ix509enrollment">IX509Enrollment</a> object by calling one of the following methods.<ul>
<li>
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-ix509enrollment-initialize">Initialize</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-ix509enrollment-initializefromrequest">InitializeFromRequest</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-ix509enrollment-initializefromtemplatename">InitializeFromTemplateName</a>
</li>
</ul>


If the enrollment operation succeeds, the function  returns <b>S_OK</b>. However, this does not necessarily mean that the response from the CA was installed. Call  the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-ix509enrollment-get_status">Status</a> property to determine the enrollment status.
