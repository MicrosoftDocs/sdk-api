# IX509Enrollment::get_Certificate


## -description


The <b>Certificate</b> property retrieves the installed certificate. The certificate is contained in a byte array that is encoded by using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/d-gly">Distinguished Encoding Rules</a> (DER) as defined by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/a-gly">Abstract Syntax Notation One</a> (ASN.1) standard.  The DER-encoded byte array is represented by a string that is  either a pure binary sequence or Unicode encoded.

This property is read-only.
