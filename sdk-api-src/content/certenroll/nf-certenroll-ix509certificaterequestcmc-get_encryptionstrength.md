This property is related to the following properties:<ul>
<li>
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-ix509certificaterequestcmc-get_archiveprivatekey">ArchivePrivateKey</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-ix509certificaterequestcmc-get_encryptedkeyhash">EncryptedKeyHash</a>

The encryption strength is often implied by the encryption algorithm. If the algorithm does not support multiple strengths, you should not set the <b>EncryptionStrength</b> property.

You must set this property, if at all,  before calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-ix509certificaterequest-encode">Encode</a> method, but you must initialize the CMC request object before calling the property. For more information, see the following topics:<ul>
