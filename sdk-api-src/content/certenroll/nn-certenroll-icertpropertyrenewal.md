# ICertPropertyRenewal interface


## -description

The <b>ICertPropertyRenewal</b> interface represents a certificate property that contains a SHA-1 hash of the new certificate created when an existing certificate is renewed. This property is associated with the old certificate to identify the new certificate that replaces it.  Typically, the SHA-1 hash is referred to as the thumb print of a certificate.

This property is initialized by the enrollment process after the client requests that a certificate be renewed. If a new certificate is issued, the property is associated with the old certificate in the personal store.<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/ne-certenroll-certenroll_propertyid">CERTENROLL_PROPERTYID</a> value is XCN_CERT_RENEWAL_PROP_ID.</div>
