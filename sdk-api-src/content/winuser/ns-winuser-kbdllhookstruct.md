# KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT structure


## -description


Contains information about a low-level keyboard input event. 


## -struct-fields




### -field vkCode

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/inputdev/virtual-key-codes">virtual-key code</a>. The code must be a value in the range 1 to 254. 


### -field scanCode

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

A hardware scan code for the key. 


### -field flags

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The extended-key flag, event-injected flags, context code, and transition-state flag. This member is specified as follows. An application can use the following values to test the keystroke flags. Testing LLKHF_INJECTED (bit 4) will tell you whether the event was injected. If it was, then testing LLKHF_LOWER_IL_INJECTED (bit 1) will tell you whether or not the event was injected from a process running at lower integrity level.

<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>Specifies whether the key is an extended key, such as a function key or a key on the numeric keypad. The value is 1 if the key is an extended key; otherwise, it is 0.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Specifies whether the event was injected from a process running at lower integrity level. The value is 1 if that is the case; otherwise, it is 0. Note that bit 4 is also set whenever bit 1 is set.</td>

<tr>
<td>2-3</td>
<td>Reserved.</td>
