## -struct-fields




### -field logicalMin

The minimum value that the device can report for this property.


### -field logicalMax

The maximum value that the device can report for this property.


### -field physicalMin

The physical minimum  in Himetric.


### -field physicalMax

The physical maximum in Himetric.


### -field unit

The unit.


### -field unitExponent

The exponent.


### -field usagePageId

The usage page for the property, as documented in the HID specification.


### -field usageId

## -remarks



Developers can use this function to determine the properties that a device supports beyond the standard ones that are delivered through <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/inputmsg/messages-and-notifications">Pointer Input Messages and Notifications</a>. The properties map directly to HID usages.
