# POINTER_DEVICE_TYPE enumeration


## -description

Identifies the pointer device types.

## -enum-fields

### -field POINTER_DEVICE_TYPE_INTEGRATED_PEN

Direct pen digitizer (integrated into display).

### -field POINTER_DEVICE_TYPE_EXTERNAL_PEN

Indirect pen digitizer (not integrated into display).

### -field POINTER_DEVICE_TYPE_TOUCH

Touch digitizer.

### -field POINTER_DEVICE_TYPE_TOUCH_PAD

Touchpad digitizer (Windows 8.1 and later).

### -field POINTER_DEVICE_TYPE_MAX

Forces this enumeration to compile to 32 bits in size. Without this value, some compilers would allow this enumeration to compile to a size other than 32 bits. You should not use this value.
