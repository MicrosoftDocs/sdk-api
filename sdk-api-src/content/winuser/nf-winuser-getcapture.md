# GetCapture function


## -description

Retrieves a handle to the window (if any) that has captured the mouse. Only one window at a time can capture the mouse; this window receives mouse input whether or not the cursor is within its borders.



## -returns

Type: <b>HWND</b>

The return value is a handle to the capture window associated with the current thread. If no window in the thread has captured the mouse, the return value is <b>NULL</b>.

## -remarks

A <b>NULL</b> return value means the current thread has not captured the mouse. However, it is possible that another thread or process has captured the mouse. 

To get a handle to the capture window on another thread, use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getguithreadinfo">GetGUIThreadInfo</a> function.
