# DrawFocusRect function


## -description

The <b>DrawFocusRect</b> function draws a rectangle in the style used to indicate that the rectangle has the focus.

## -parameters

### -param hDC [in]

A handle to the device context.

### -param lprc [in]

A pointer to a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/windef/ns-windef-rect">RECT</a> structure that specifies the logical coordinates of the rectangle.

## -returns

If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero.

If the function fails, the return value is zero.

## -remarks

<b>DrawFocusRect</b> works only in MM_TEXT mode.

Because <b>DrawFocusRect</b> is an XOR function, calling it a second time with the same rectangle removes the rectangle from the screen.

This function draws a rectangle that cannot be scrolled. To scroll an area containing a rectangle drawn by this function, call <b>DrawFocusRect</b> to remove the rectangle from the screen, scroll the area, and then call <b>DrawFocusRect</b> again to draw the rectangle in the new position.

<b>Windows XP:</b> The focus rectangle can now be thicker than 1 pixel, so it is more visible for high-resolution, high-density displays and accessibility needs. This is handled by the SPI_SETFOCUSBORDERWIDTH and SPI_SETFOCUSBORDERHEIGHT in <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-systemparametersinfoa">SystemParametersInfo</a>.
