# IsWinEventHookInstalled function


## -description

Determines whether there is an installed WinEvent hook that might be notified of a specified event.

## -parameters

### -param event [in]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">DWORD</a></b>

The event constant that hooks might be notified of. The function checks whether there is an installed hook for this event constant.

## -returns

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">BOOL</a></b>

If there is a hook to be notified of the specified event, the return value is <b>TRUE</b>.

If there are no hooks to be notified of the specified event, the return value is <b>FALSE</b>.

## -remarks

This method is guaranteed to never return a false negative. If this method returns <b>FALSE</b>, it means that no hooks in the system would be notified of the event. However, this method may return a false positive. In other words, it may return <b>TRUE</b> even though there are no hooks that would be notified. Thus, it is safe for components to circumvent some work if this method returns <b>FALSE</b>. 

Event hooks can be installed at any time, so server developers should not cache the return value for long periods of time.
