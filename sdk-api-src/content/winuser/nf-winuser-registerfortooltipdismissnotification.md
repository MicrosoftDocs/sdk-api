## -description

Registers or unregisters windows to receive notification to dismiss their tooltip windows.

## -parameters

### -param hWnd

Type: **HWND**

The handle of the window to receive the **WM_TOOLTIPDISMISS** message.

### -param tdFlags

Type: **[TOOLTIP_DISMISS_FLAGS](ne-winuser-tooltip_dismiss_flags.md)**

A value of the enumeration that specifies whether the function registers or unregisters the window. **TDF_REGISTER** to register; **TDF_UNREGISTER** to unregister.

## -returns

**TRUE** if the window was successfully registered or unregistered; otherwise, **FALSE**. (See Remarks.)

## -remarks

This function makes tooltips more accessible by letting apps and frameworks that support tooltips register and unregister to be notified by a **WM_TOOLTIPDISMISS** message when the system requires all showing tooltips to be dismissed.

Apps should register for this notification each time they show a tooltip and hide their tooltips in response to a **WM_TOOLTIPDISMISS** message. When a tooltip is hidden for some other reason, like a mouse action, the app should unregister.

System-defined triggers for tooltip dismissal include a solitary Ctrl key up or Ctrl+Shift+F10. (The set of triggers may change over time.)

The function takes either the **HWND** of a tooltip window or the **HWND** of an app window that has child tooltips.  

- If a tooltip **HWND** itself is registered, the tooltip window is expected to register upon showing and to dismiss upon receiving a **WM_TOOLTIPDISMISS** message.  
- If an app **HWND** registers on behalf of its tooltips, the app's window is expected to register upon showing tooltips and dismiss all of its tooltips upon receiving a **WM_TOOLTIPDISMISS** message.  

Tooltip or app windows are expected to call the function to register each time tooltips are shown. Registered windows are automatically unregistered upon posting **WM_TOOLTIPDISMISS**.

The **TDF_UNREGISTER** flag is used to explicitly unregister a window when a tooltip window is dismissed by application or framework prerogative (such as moving the cursor out of the "safe zone"). If an app or framework calls `RegisterForTooltipDismissNotification` with **TDF_UNREGISTER** after the window has been automatically unregistered, the function returns **FALSE**. There is no impact on future registrations.

### Return values

The HWND passed into the function must be owned by the calling process; otherwise, the function returns **FALSE**.

When called with **TDF_REGISTER** and a window belonging to the calling process, the function returns **TRUE** if the window was successfully registered or **FALSE** if the window was already registered. The window is treated as registered either way.

When called with **TDF_UNREGISTER** and a windows belonging to the calling process, the function returns **TRUE** if the window is successfully unregistered, or **FALSE** if the windows was not currently registered. The window is treated as unregistered either way.
