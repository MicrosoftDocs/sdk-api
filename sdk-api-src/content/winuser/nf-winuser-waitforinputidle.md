# WaitForInputIdle function


## -description

Waits until the specified process has finished processing its initial input and is waiting for user input with no input pending, or until the time-out interval has elapsed.

## -parameters

### -param hProcess [in]

A handle to the process. If this process is a console application or does not have a message queue, 
<b>WaitForInputIdle</b> returns immediately.

### -param dwMilliseconds [in]

The time-out interval, in milliseconds. If <i>dwMilliseconds</i> is INFINITE, the function does not return until the process is idle.

## -returns

The following table shows the possible return values for this function.

## -remarks

The 
<b>WaitForInputIdle</b> function enables a thread to suspend its execution until the specified process has finished its initialization and is waiting for user input with no input pending. If the process has multiple threads, the <b>WaitForInputIdle</b> function returns as soon as any thread becomes idle. 

<b>WaitForInputIdle</b>  can be used at any time, not just during application startup. However, <b>WaitForInputIdle</b> waits only once for a process to become idle; subsequent <b>WaitForInputIdle</b> calls return immediately, whether the process is idle or busy. 

<b>WaitForInputIdle</b> can be useful for synchronizing a parent process and a newly created child process. When a parent process creates a child process, the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessa">CreateProcess</a> function returns without waiting for the child process to finish its initialization. Before trying to communicate with the child process, the parent process can use 
the <b>WaitForInputIdle</b> function to determine when the child's initialization has been completed. For example, the parent process should use 
the <b>WaitForInputIdle</b> function before trying to find a window associated with the child process.
