# SwitchDesktop function


## -description


Makes the specified desktop visible and activates it. This enables the desktop to receive input from the user. The calling process must have DESKTOP_SWITCHDESKTOP access to the desktop for the 
<b>SwitchDesktop</b> function to succeed.


## -parameters




### -param hDesktop [in]

A handle to the desktop. This handle is returned by the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-createdesktopa">CreateDesktop</a> and 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-opendesktopa">OpenDesktop</a> functions.

This desktop must be associated with the current window station for the process.


## -returns



If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero.

If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, call 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a>. However, 
<b>SwitchDesktop</b> only sets the last error for the following cases:

<ul>
<li>When the desktop belongs to an invisible window station</li>
<li>When <i>hDesktop</i> is an invalid handle, refers to a destroyed desktop, or belongs to a different session than that of the calling process</li>
</ul>



## -remarks



The 
<b>SwitchDesktop</b> function fails if the desktop belongs to an invisible window station. 
<b>SwitchDesktop</b> also fails when called from a process that is associated with a secured desktop such as the WinLogon and ScreenSaver desktops. Processes that are associated with a secured desktop include custom UserInit processes. Such calls typically fail with an "access denied" error.
