# SHCreateShellFolderViewEx function


## -description

Creates a new instance of the default Shell folder view object. It is recommended that you use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shlobj_core/nf-shlobj_core-shcreateshellfolderview">SHCreateShellFolderView</a> rather than this function.

## -parameters

### -param pcsfv [in]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/api/shlobj_core/ns-shlobj_core-csfv">CSFV</a>*</b>

Pointer to a structure that describes the details used in creating this instance of the Shell folder view object.

### -param ppsv [out]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-ishellview">IShellView</a>**</b>

The address of an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-ishellview">IShellView</a> interface pointer that, when this function returns successfully, points to the new view object. On failure, this value is <b>NULL</b>.

## -returns

Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this function succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

## -remarks

<a href="/windows/desktop/api/shlobj_core/nf-shlobj_core-shcreateshellfolderview">SHCreateShellFolderView</a> is recommended over <b>SHCreateShellFolderViewEx</b> because of the greater flexibility of its elements to participate in various scenarios, provide new functionality to the view, and interact with other objects.

When dealing with several instances of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-ishellview">IShellView</a>, you might want to verify which is the default Shell folder view object. To do so, call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-queryinterface(q)">QueryInterface</a> on the object using IID_CDefView. This call succeeds only on the default Shell folder view object.
