# SHDefExtractIconA function


## -description

Provides a default handler to extract an icon from a file.

## -parameters

### -param pszIconFile [in]

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

A pointer to a null-terminated buffer that contains the path and name of the file from which the icon is extracted.

### -param iIndex

Type: <b>int</b>

The location of the icon within the file named in <i>pszIconFile</i>. If this is a positive number, it refers to the zero-based position of the icon in the file. For instance, 0 refers to the 1st icon in the resource file and 2 refers to the 3rd. If this is a negative number, it refers to the icon's resource ID.

### -param uFlags [in]

Type: <b>UINT</b>

A flag that controls the icon extraction.



#### GIL_SIMULATEDOC

Overlays the extracted icon on the default document icon to create the final icon. This icon can be used when no more appropriate icon can be found or retrieved.

### -param phiconLarge [out, optional]

Type: <b>HICON*</b>

A pointer to an HICON that, when this function returns successfully, receives the handle of the large version of the icon specified in the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms632659(v=vs.85)">LOWORD</a> of <i>nIconSize</i>. This value can be <b>NULL</b>.

### -param phiconSmall [out, optional]

Type: <b>HICON*</b>

A pointer to an HICON that, when this function returns successfully, receives the handle of the small version of the icon specified in the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms632657(v=vs.85)">HIWORD</a> of <i>nIconSize</i>.

### -param nIconSize

Type: <b>UINT</b>

A value that contains the large icon size in its <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms632659(v=vs.85)">LOWORD</a> and the small icon size in its <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms632657(v=vs.85)">HIWORD</a>. Size is measured in pixels. Pass 0 to specify default large and small sizes.

## -returns

> [!NOTE]
> The shlobj_core.h header defines SHDefExtractIcon as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
