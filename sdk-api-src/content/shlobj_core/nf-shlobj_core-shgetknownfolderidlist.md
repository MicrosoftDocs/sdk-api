# SHGetKnownFolderIDList function


## -description


Retrieves the path of a known folder as an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shtypes/ns-shtypes-itemidlist">ITEMIDLIST</a> structure.


## -parameters




### -param rfid [in]

Type: <b>REFKNOWNFOLDERID</b>

A reference to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/shell/knownfolderid">KNOWNFOLDERID</a> that identifies the folder. The folders associated with the known folder IDs might not exist on a particular system.


### -param dwFlags [in]

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Flags that specify special retrieval options. This value can be 0; otherwise, it is one or more of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shlobj_core/ne-shlobj_core-known_folder_flag">KNOWN_FOLDER_FLAG</a> values.


### -param hToken [in]

Type: <b>HANDLE</b>

An <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecAuthZ/access-tokens">access token</a> used to represent a particular user. This parameter is usually set to <b>NULL</b>, in which case the function tries to access the current user's instance of the folder. However, you may need to assign a value to <i>hToken</i> for those folders that can have multiple users but are treated as belonging to a single user. The most commonly used folder of this type is <b>Documents</b>.

The calling application is responsible for correct impersonation when <i>hToken</i> is non-null. It must have appropriate security privileges for the particular user, including TOKEN_QUERY and TOKEN_IMPERSONATE, and the user's registry hive must be currently mounted. See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecAuthZ/access-control">Access Control</a> for further discussion of access control issues.

Assigning the <i>hToken</i> parameter a value of -1 indicates the Default User. This allows clients of <b>SHGetKnownFolderIDList</b> to find folder locations (such as the <b>Desktop</b> folder) for the Default User. The Default User user profile is duplicated when any new user account is created, and includes special folders such as <b>Documents</b> and <b>Desktop</b>. Any items added to the Default User folder also appear in any new user account. Note that access to the Default User folders requires administrator privileges.


### -param ppidl [out]

Type: <b>PIDLIST_ABSOLUTE*</b>

When this method returns, contains a pointer to the PIDL of the folder. This parameter is passed uninitialized. The caller is responsible for freeing the returned PIDL when it is no longer needed by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shlobj_core/nf-shlobj_core-ilfree">ILFree</a>.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

Returns S_OK if successful, or an error value otherwise, including the following:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_INVALIDARG</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Among other things, this value can indicate that the <i>rfid</i> parameter references a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/shell/knownfolderid">KNOWNFOLDERID</a> that is not present on the system. Not all <b>KNOWNFOLDERID</b> values are present on all systems. Use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-iknownfoldermanager-getfolderids">IKnownFolderManager::GetFolderIds</a> to retrieve the set of <b>KNOWNFOLDERID</b> values for the current system.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



This function replaces <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shlobj_core/nf-shlobj_core-shgetfolderlocation">SHGetFolderLocation</a>. That older function is now simply a wrapper for <b>SHGetKnownFolderIDList</b>.

Callers using this function must have at least User privileges.

Some known folders, for example, the <b>Documents</b> folder, are per-user. Each user has a different path for the <b>Documents</b> folder. If <i>hToken</i> is <b>NULL</b>, the API tries to access the current user's instance of the folder. If <i>hToken</i> is a valid user token, the API tries to impersonate the user using this token, and attempts to access that user's instance of the folder.
