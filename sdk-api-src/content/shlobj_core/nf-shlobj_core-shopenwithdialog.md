# SHOpenWithDialog function


## -description

Displays the <b>Open With</b> dialog box.

## -parameters

### -param hwndParent [in, optional]

Type: <b>HWND</b>

The handle of the parent window. This value can be <b>NULL</b>.

### -param poainfo [in]

Type: <b>const <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shlobj_core/ns-shlobj_core-openasinfo">OPENASINFO</a>*</b>

A pointer to an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shlobj_core/ns-shlobj_core-openasinfo">OPENASINFO</a> structure, which specifies the contents of the resulting dialog.

## -returns

Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this function succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.

## -remarks

Starting in Windows 10, the <b>OAIF_ALLOW_REGISTRATION</b>, <b>OAIF_FORCE_REGISTRATION</b>, and <b>OAIF_HIDE_REGISTRATION</b> flags will be ignored by <b>SHOpenWithDialog</b>. The <b>Open With</b> dialog box can no longer be used to change the default program used to open a file extension. You can only use <b>SHOpenWithDialog</b> to open a single file.

If <b>SHOpenWithDialog</b> is called without passing <b>OAIF_EXEC</b>, the user will receive a dialog that informs them that they can change the default programs used to open file extensions in their <b>Settings</b>.
