# IShellDetails interface


## -description

Exposed by Shell folders to provide detailed information about the items in a folder. This is the same information that is displayed by the Windows Explorer when the view of the folder is set to Details. For Windows 2000 and later systems, <b>IShellDetails</b> is superseded by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-ishellfolder2">IShellFolder2</a>.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IShellDetails</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IShellDetails</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

For Windows 2000 and later systems, folder objects should implement <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-ishellfolder2">IShellFolder2</a> instead of this interface. However, if your application needs to function on earlier systems, <b>IShellDetails</b> should also be exposed.
