# IACList::Expand


## -description

Requests that the autocompletion client generate candidate strings associated with a specified item in its namespace.

## -parameters

### -param pszExpand [in]

Type: <b>PCWSTR</b>

A pointer to a null-terminated, Unicode string to be expanded by the autocomplete object.

## -returns

Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

## -remarks

The autocomplete object calls this method when a delimiter is entered in the edit control. If the string pointed to by <i>pszExpand</i> matches an item in the autocompletion client's namespace, the client generates strings for those items that fall immediately under <i>pszExpand</i> in its namespace hierarchy. The client returns those strings next time the autocompletion object calls the client's <a href="/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-ienumstring">IEnumString</a> interface.

For example, assuming that the client's namespace consists of all the files and folders on the C: drive, and <i>pszExpand</i> is set to "C:\Program Files\", the client should generate a list of strings corresponding to the fully qualified paths of the files and subfolders of "C:\Program Files\".
