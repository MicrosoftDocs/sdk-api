# IActiveDesktop interface


## -description

Allows a client program to manage the desktop items and wallpaper on a local computer.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IActiveDesktop</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IActiveDesktop</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

Your code must include Wininet.h before it includes Shlobj.h. Failure to do so will result in a compiler error.
