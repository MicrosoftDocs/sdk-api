# IACList interface


## -description


Exposes a method that improves the efficiency of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shldisp/nn-shldisp-iautocomplete">autocompletion</a> when the candidate strings are organized in a hierarchy.


## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IACList</b> interface inherits from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IACList</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -members

The <b>IACList</b> interface has these methods.

## -remarks



Autocompletion typically requires the following three components:
		
        		

<ul>
<li>The autocompletion client. This client is a window, such as a dialog box, that hosts the edit control.</li>
<li>The autocompletion object (CLSID_AutoComplete). This object is provided by the system, and handles the user interface, parsing, and background thread management.</li>
<li>The autocompletion list object. This object is responsible for providing lists of candidate strings to the autocompletion object.</li>
</ul>
A simple autocompletion list object needs only to export <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-ienumstring">IEnumString</a> in addition to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a>. When the user enters characters in the edit box, the autocompletion object calls the list object's <b>IEnumString</b> interface to enumerate the list of strings that can be used to complete the partial string. The list object maintains a namespace and decides which of those strings are relevant.

The simplest approach a list object takes is to return every string in its namespace every time the autocompletion object makes a request. For a discussion of how to implement this type of list object, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shldisp/nn-shldisp-iautocomplete">IAutoComplete</a>. However, this approach is practical only if the namespace is relatively small. When large numbers of strings are involved, the list object must restrict itself to a small subset of the namespace.

The <b>IACList</b> interface is exported by autocompletion list objects to help them choose a sensible subset of strings from a hierarchically organized namespace. With a large namespace, this procedure substantially increases the efficiency of autocompletion. The basic procedure is as follows:

				

<ol>
<li>The autocomplete object calls the list object's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-ienumstring">IEnumString</a> interface. The list object returns the names of the top-level items in the hierarchy. For example, if the namespace consists of every file and folder on the C: drive, the list object returns the fully qualified paths of the folders and files contained in the C:\ directory.</li>
<li>The user continues to type until he or she enters a delimiter. The '\' and '/' characters are recognized as delimiters by the autocompletion object.</li>
<li>The autocompletion object calls the list object's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shlobj_core/nf-shlobj_core-iaclist-expand">IACList::Expand</a> method and passes it the current partial string.</li>
<li>The autocomplete object calls the list object's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-ienumstring">IEnumString</a> interface again to request a new list of strings. If the partial string matches one of the top-level items in the namespace, the list object returns the names of the items that fall immediately under the selected item. For instance, if the user has entered "C:\Program Files\", the list object returns the names of the files and folders contained in that directory. If the name passed to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shlobj_core/nf-shlobj_core-iaclist-expand">IACList::Expand</a> does not match any top-level item, the list object can simply stop returning strings until the autocomplete object calls <b>IACList::Expand</b> with a string that is in the list object's namespace.</li>
<li>The process continues until the user selects a string, typically by pressing the <b>ENTER</b> key.</li>
</ol>
