# IWMPEvents2::CreatePartnershipComplete


## -description



The <b>CreatePartnershipComplete</b> event occurs when an asynchronous call to <b>IWMPSyncDevice::createPartnership</b> completes.




## -parameters




### -param pDevice [in]

Address of the <b>IWMPSyncDevice</b> interface that represents the device object for which the partnership was created.


### -param hrResult [in]

The success or error <b>HRESULT</b> for the create partnership operation.


## -remarks



A call to <b>IWMPSyncDevice::createPartnership</b> starts the asynchronous operation of creating a partnership between Windows Media Player and a device. This call returns immediately. When the operation that creates the partnership ends, <b>CreatePartnershipComplete</b> occurs.

Receiving this event notification does not guarantee that a partnership exists.

This event is broadcasted to all remoted Windows Media Player control instances.

Use <b>IWMPSyncDevice::isIdentical</b> to determine whether a particular device matches the device for which the partnership was created.

You can also handle this event through an <b>IDispatch</b> event sink by using the <b>_WMPOCXEvents</b> interface.

<b>Windows Media Player 10 Mobile: </b>This event is not supported.
