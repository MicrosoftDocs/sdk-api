# IWMPPlayerApplication interface


## -description

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The <b>IWMPPlayerApplication</b> interface provides methods for switching between a remoted Windows Media Player control and the full mode of the Player. These methods can only be used with C++ programs that embed the control in remote mode.

## -inheritance

The <b>IWMPPlayerApplication</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oaidl/nn-oaidl-idispatch">IDispatch</a> interface. <b>IWMPPlayerApplication</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="/">Methods</a></li>
