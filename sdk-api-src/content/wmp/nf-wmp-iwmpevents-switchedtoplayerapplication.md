# IWMPEvents::SwitchedToPlayerApplication


## -description

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The <b>SwitchedToPlayerApplication</b> event occurs when a remoted Windows Media Player control switches to the full mode of the Player.



## -remarks

This event occurs only when remoting the Windows Media Player control.

<b>Windows Media Player 10 Mobile: </b>This event is not supported.
