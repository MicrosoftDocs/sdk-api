# IWMPDVD::topMenu


## -description



The <b>topMenu</b> method stops playback and displays the top (or root) menu for the current title.




## -parameters






## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method succeeded.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



Every DVD is authored differently. The DVD must contain a menu for this method to work. Some DVDs are authored so that the <b>topMenu</b> and <b>IWMPDVD::titleMenu</b> methods open the same menu. The <b>topMenu</b> method usually invokes the top (or root) menu, but it may invoke the title menu if there is no root menu available.

<b>Windows Media Player 10 Mobile: </b>This method always returns S_OK, but does not perform the intended operation.
