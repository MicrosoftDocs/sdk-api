## -remarks

When the Windows Media Player control is connected to a digital media file that can be played and downloaded at the same time, the <b>get_downloadProgress</b> method retrieves the percentage of the total file that has been downloaded. This feature is currently supported only for digital media files downloaded from web servers. The following file formats can be downloaded and played simultaneously:

<ul>
<li>Advanced Systems Format (ASF)</li>
<li>Windows Media Audio (WMA)</li>
<li>Windows Media Video (WMV)</li>
<li>MP3</li>
<li>MPEG</li>
<li>WAV</li>
</ul>
In addition, some AVI files can be downloaded and played simultaneously.

Use the <b>IWMPEvents::Buffering</b> event to determine when buffering starts or stops.
