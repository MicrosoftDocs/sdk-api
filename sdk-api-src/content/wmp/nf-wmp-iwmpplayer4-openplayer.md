<b>BSTR</b> containing the URL of the media item to play.

</td>
<td width="60%">
The method succeeded.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## -remarks

This method launches Windows Media Player with the specified URL set as the current media item. If the Player was previously closed in skin mode it will open using the skin last chosen by the user. Otherwise, the Player opens in full mode.

If this method is called from a Windows Media Player ActiveX control embedded in remote mode, its behavior is identical to the <b>IWMPPlayerAppication::switchToPlayerApplication</b> method.

<b>Windows Media Player 10 Mobile: </b>This method always returns E_NOTIMPL.
