# IWMPDVD::back


## -description



The <b>back</b> method returns the display from a submenu to its parent menu.




## -parameters






## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method succeeded.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



Every DVD is authored differently. Some DVDs are authored so that the <b>back</b> method is available from the root menu, but when invoked, it will do nothing.

<b>Windows Media Player 10 Mobile: </b>This method always returns S_OK, but does not perform the intended operation.
