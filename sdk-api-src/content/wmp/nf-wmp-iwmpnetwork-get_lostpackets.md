## -remarks

This method retrieves streaming media packets only, and will equal zero when using the HTTP protocol, which is lossless.

Packets may be lost for a number of reasons, such as the type and quality of the network connection.

Each time playback is stopped and restarted, the value retrieved from this method is reset to zero. The value is not reset if playback is paused. This method retrieves valid information only during run time when the URL for playback is set by using the <b>IWMPCore::put_URL</b> method.
