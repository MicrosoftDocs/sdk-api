# IWMPControls::fastReverse


## -description

## -remarks

The <b>fastReverse</b> method scans the clip in reverse at five times the normal speed, displaying only the key frames if it is a video file. Calling <b>fastReverse</b> is equivalent to specifying -5.0 for the rate through the <b>IWMPSettings::put_rate</b> method. If the rate is subsequently changed, or if <b>IWMPControls::play</b> or <b>IWMPControls::stop</b> is called, Windows Media Player will cease fast reverse.

If the item is part of a playlist, <b>fastReverse</b> stops at the beginning of the current track. For instance, if track 3 is in <b>fastReverse</b>, when the beginning of track 3 is reached, Windows Media Player will not go to track 2. The play count is not incremented when calling <b>fastReverse</b>.

If you call <b>IWMPControls::fastForward</b> while <b>fastReverse</b> is running, <b>fastReverse</b> will be stopped and <b>IWMPControls::fastForward</b> will begin.

This method does not work for live broadcasts and certain digital media types. To determine whether you can use fast reverse in a clip, call the <b>IWMPControls::get_isAvailable</b> method and pass in the <b>BSTR</b> value "FastReverse".
