# IMFClock::GetCorrelatedTime


## -description


Retrieves the last clock time that was correlated with system time.
        


## -parameters




### -param dwReserved [in]

Reserved, must be zero.
          


### -param pllClockTime [out]

Receives the last known clock time, in units of the clock's frequency.
          


### -param phnsSystemTime [out]

Receives the system time that corresponds to the clock time returned in <i>pllClockTime</i>, in 100-nanosecond units.
          


## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>MF_E_CLOCK_NO_TIME_SOURCE</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">

## -remarks



At some fixed interval, a clock correlates its internal clock ticks with the system time. (The system time is the time returned by the high-resolution performance counter.) This method returns:

<ul>
<li>The most recent clock time that was correlated with system time.
          </li>
<li>The system time when the correlation was performed.
          </li>
</ul>
The clock time is returned in the <i>pllClockTime</i> parameter and is expressed in units of the clock's frequency. If the clock's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfidl/nf-mfidl-imfclock-getclockcharacteristics">IMFClock::GetClockCharacteristics</a> method returns the <b>MFCLOCK_CHARACTERISTICS_FLAG_FREQUENCY_10MHZ</b> flag, the clock's frequency is 10 MHz (each clock tick is 100 nanoseconds). Otherwise, you can get the clock's frequency by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfidl/nf-mfidl-imfclock-getproperties">IMFClock::GetProperties</a>. The frequency is given in the <b>qwClockFrequency</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfidl/ns-mfidl-mfclock_properties">MFCLOCK_PROPERTIES</a> structure returned by that method.
      

The system time is returned in the <i>phnsSystemTime</i> parameter, and is always expressed in 100-nanosecond units.
      

To find out how often the clock correlates its clock time with the system time, call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfidl/nf-mfidl-imfclock-getproperties">GetProperties</a>. The correlation interval is given in the <b>qwCorrelationRate</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfidl/ns-mfidl-mfclock_properties">MFCLOCK_PROPERTIES</a> structure. If <b>qwCorrelationRate</b> is zero, it means the clock performs the correlation whenever <b>GetCorrelatedTime</b> is called. Otherwise, you can calculate the current clock time by extrapolating from the last correlated time.
      

Some clocks support rate changes through the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfidl/nn-mfidl-imfratecontrol">IMFRateControl</a> interface. If so, the clock time advances at a speed of frequency × current rate. If a clock does not expose the <b>IMFRateControl</b> interface, the rate is always 1.0.
      

For the presentation clock, the clock time is the presentation time, and is always relative to the starting time specified in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfidl/nf-mfidl-imfpresentationclock-start">IMFPresentationClock::Start</a>. You can also get the presentation time by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfidl/nf-mfidl-imfpresentationclock-gettime">IMFPresentationClock::GetTime</a>.
