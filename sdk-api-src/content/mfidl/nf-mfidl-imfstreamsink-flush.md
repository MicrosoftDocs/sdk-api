## -description

## -parameters






## -returns



The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b>. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method succeeded.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>MF_E_NOT_INITIALIZED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The stream sink has not been initialized yet. You might need to set a media type.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>MF_E_SHUTDOWN</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The media sink's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfidl/nf-mfidl-imfmediasink-shutdown">Shutdown</a> method has been called.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>MF_E_STREAMSINK_REMOVED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
This stream was removed from the media sink and is no longer valid.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



If any samples are still queued from previous calls to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfidl/nf-mfidl-imfstreamsink-processsample">IMFStreamSink::ProcessSample</a> method, the media sink immediately discards them, without processing them. This can cause a glitch in the rendered output. The running state of the sink (running, paused, or stopped) does not change.

Any pending marker events from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfidl/nf-mfidl-imfstreamsink-placemarker">IMFStreamSink::PlaceMarker</a> method are dispatched immediately, with the status code E_ABORT.

This method is synchronous. It does not return until the sink has discarded all pending samples.
