# MF_CONNECT_METHOD enumeration


## -description


Specifies how the topology loader connects a topology node. This enumeration is used with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/medfound/mf-toponode-connect-method-attribute">MF_TOPONODE_CONNECT_METHOD</a> attribute.
        
      


## -enum-fields




### -field MF_CONNECT_DIRECT

Connect the node directly to its upstream neighbor. Fail otherwise.
          


### -field MF_CONNECT_ALLOW_CONVERTER

Add a converter transform upstream from this node, if needed to complete the connection. Converter transforms include color-space converters for video, and audio resamplers for audio.
          


### -field MF_CONNECT_ALLOW_DECODER

Add a decoder transform upstream upstream from this node, if needed to complete the connection. The numeric value of this flag includes the <b>MF_CONNECT_ALLOW_CONVERTER</b> flag. Therefore, setting the <b>MF_CONNECT_ALLOW_DECODER</b> flag sets the <b>MF_CONNECT_ALLOW_CONVERTER</b> flag as well.
          


### -field MF_CONNECT_RESOLVE_INDEPENDENT_OUTPUTTYPES

Controls the order in which the topology loader attempts to  
            use different output types from this node. Currently, this flag applies only to source nodes. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/medfound/mf-topology-enumerate-source-types">MF_TOPOLOGY_ENUMERATE_SOURCE_TYPES</a>. 

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Requires Windows 7 or later.</div>
<div> </div>

### -field MF_CONNECT_AS_OPTIONAL

This node is optional. If the topology loader cannot connect this node, it will skip the node and continue.
          


### -field MF_CONNECT_AS_OPTIONAL_BRANCH

The entire topology branch starting at this node is optional. If the topology loader cannot resolve this branch, it will skip the branch and continue.
