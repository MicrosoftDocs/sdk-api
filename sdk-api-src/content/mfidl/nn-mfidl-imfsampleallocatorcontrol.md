## -description

Implemented by video capture sources and transforms. Allows the system to provide components with a sample allocator to allocate samples using memory that is accessible from within a container.

## -remarks

Components that do not implement this interface, or do not use the allocator provided by the system, can still allocate samples, but when running from inside a container, the system will have to copy all samples into container memory, which is less efficient.
