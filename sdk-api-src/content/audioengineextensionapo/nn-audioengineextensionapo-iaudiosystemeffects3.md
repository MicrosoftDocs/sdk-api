## -description

Implementing this interface also implies that the APO supports the APO Settings framework and allows the APO to subscribe for common audio related notifications from the Audio Engine

This interface is also implemented by clients that require an [APOInitSystemEffects3](ns-audioengineextensionapo-apoinitsystemeffects3.md) structure to be passed into the [IAudioProcessingObject::Initialize](..//audioenginebaseapo/nf-audioenginebaseapo-iaudioprocessingobject-initialize.md) method. **APOInitSystemEffects3** adds the ability to obtain a service provider such as [IAudioProcessingObjectLoggingService](nn-audioengineextensionapo-iaudioprocessingobjectloggingservice.md) or [IAudioProcessingObjectRTQueueService](nn-audioengineextensionapo-iaudioprocessingobjectrtqueueservice.md). 

> [!NOTE]
> On OS versions earlier than Windows Build 22000, the system will not pass an **APOInitSystemEffects3** into **IAudioProcessingObject::Initialize** even if the client implements **IAudioSystemEffects3**, but will instead pass an older version of the structure, [APOInitSystemEffects2](/windows/win32/api/audioenginebaseapo/ns-audioenginebaseapo-apoinitsystemeffects2) or [APOInitSystemEffects](/windows/win32/api/audioenginebaseapo/ns-audioenginebaseapo-apoinitsystemeffects), into **Initialize**.
