# IConfigAsfWriter interface


## -description

The <code>IConfigAsfWriter</code> interface configures the <a href="/windows/desktop/DirectShow/wm-asf-writer-filter">WM ASF Writer</a> filter. It provides methods for getting and setting the profiles and indexing mode.

When the WM ASF Writer filter is created, it is configured automatically with a default ASF audio-visual profile based on the incoming streams. A profile describes various attributes of an ASF file such as bit rate, number and type of streams, compression quality, and so on. The filter uses the profile to determine what kind of ASF file to write, how many input pins to create, and what media types to accept. When the WM ASF Writer filter is first created, it is configured automatically with the following default profile: WMProfile_V80_256Video. However, using this profile is not recommended because it does not use the Windows Media Audio and Video 9 Series codecs.

## -inheritance
