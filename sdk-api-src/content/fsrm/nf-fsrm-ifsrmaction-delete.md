## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[This method is supported for compatibility but it's recommended to use the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fsrm/fsrm-wmi-classes">FSRM WMI Classes</a> to manage FSRM. Please see the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fsrm/msft-fsrmaction">MSFT_FSRMAction</a>,
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fsrm/msft-fsrmfmjaction">MSFT_FSRMFMJAction</a>, and 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fsrm/msft-fsrmfmjnotificationaction">MSFT_FSRMFMJNotificationAction</a> 
    classes.]

Removes the action from the quota or file screen's list of actions.


## -parameters






## -returns



The method returns the following return values.




## -remarks



Calling the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/fsrmquota/nf-fsrmquota-ifsrmquotabase-deletethreshold">IFsrmQuotaBase::DeleteThreshold</a> method also 
    deletes the actions associated with the threshold.

Note that the actions are not  deleted from the object until you call the object's 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/fsrm/nf-fsrm-ifsrmobject-commit">Commit</a> method. For example, the actions are not deleted 
    from the quota until the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/fsrm/nf-fsrm-ifsrmobject-commit">IFsrmQuota::Commit</a> 
    method is called, nor from the file screens until you call the 
    <b>IFsrmFileScreen::Commit</b> method.
