# RoGetBufferMarshaler function


## -description

Provides a standard IBuffer marshaler to implement the semantics associated with the IBuffer interface when it is marshaled.

## -parameters

### -param bufferMarshaler [out]

pointer to Windows Runtime IBuffer marshaler

## -returns

If this function succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.

## -remarks

Provided for Windows Runtime language projections.

Custom IBuffer implementations are expected to be marshaled so that the remote instance eventually copies its contents back to the original instance. The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-imarshal">IMarshal</a> implementation provided by this method handles the copy by marshaling the current value of the IBuffer and specifying a platform-provided unmarshal COM class that creates an instance with identical IBuffer contents, length, and capacity.  

The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-imarshal">IMarshal</a> implementation clones its contents to the original instance when the caller sets the Length property.
