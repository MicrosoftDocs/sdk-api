# IDsAdminNotifyHandler interface


## -description

The <b>IDsAdminNotifyHandler</b> interface is implemented by an Active Directory administrative notification handler. This interface is used by the Active Directory Users and Computers MMC snap-in to notify registered handlers when certain events, such as deleting or renaming an object, occur. The snap-in creates an instance of this object by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cocreateinstance">CoCreateInstance</a> with the CLSID of the extension.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IDsAdminNotifyHandler</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IDsAdminNotifyHandler</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>
