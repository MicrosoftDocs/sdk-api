# RECO_LATTICE_COLUMN structure


## -description

Represents a column in the lattice.

## -struct-fields

### -field key

Unused. Should be set to 0 (zero).

### -field cpProp

 Holds the properties for the column.

### -field cStrokes

Count of strokes in the <i>pStrokes</i> array for the longest element in the column.

### -field pStrokes

 An array of stroke indices in the order in which they were fed to the recognizer. For example, imagine you have two strokes, stroke one containing the word "back" and stroke two containing the word "door". The column containing "back" will have a strokes array containing one ULONG {0}. The column for "door" will have a strokes array containing two ULONG items {1,2}.

### -field cLatticeElements

Number of members in <i>pLatticeElements</i>.

### -field pLatticeElements

Array of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/rectypes/ns-rectypes-reco_lattice_element">RECO_LATTICE_ELEMENT</a> structures.

## -remarks

There is one column per recognition segment. Each column contains one or more elements. An element is usually a word or character that is a recognition alternate. Elements start with the same stroke index, but do not necessarily contain the same number of strokes (for example, see column 0 in the "together" <a href="/windows/desktop/tablet/recognizer-lattice-structure">example</a>). The structure also holds properties that are valid for the whole column.
