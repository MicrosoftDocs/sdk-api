For East Asian languages written horizontally, the descender line and baseline are located at the bottom of the characters and the ascender line at the top of the characters. The midline is between the ascender and descender lines.

For East Asian languages written vertically, the descender line is the leftmost edge, the ascender line is the rightmost edge, and baseline is between the descender and ascender lines. The midline for Komoji characters is the leftmost edge and the location for punctuation characters depends on the character.
