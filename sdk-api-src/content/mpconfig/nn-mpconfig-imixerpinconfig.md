# IMixerPinConfig interface


## -description

The <code>IMixerPinConfig</code> interface is exposed on the input pins of the <a href="/windows/desktop/DirectShow/overlay-mixer-filter">Overlay Mixer</a> filter and contains methods that manipulate video streams in various ways. The Overlay Mixer contains multiple input pins that are dynamically created as video input streams are added. The video stream on the first pin is known as the <i>primary stream</i> and subsequent streams are known as <i>secondary streams</i>.

Use this interface to manipulate the parameters involved in mixing various video streams. These parameters include getting and setting position, z-order, blending and transparency levels, aspect ratio correction, and color keys of streams.

When setting the position of video streams in the display window, the default relative position of all secondary streams is {0, 0, 0, 0}. Therefore, use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mpconfig/nf-mpconfig-imixerpinconfig-setrelativeposition">IMixerPinConfig::SetRelativePosition</a> method on secondary streams to ensure that all video streams are placed properly.

Applications use this interface to get and set attributes when mixing multiple video streams.

## -inheritance
