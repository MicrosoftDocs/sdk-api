# RpcMgmtSetComTimeout function


## -description


The 
<b>RpcMgmtSetComTimeout</b> function sets the binding-communications time-out value in a binding handle.


## -parameters




### -param Binding

Server binding handle whose time-out value is set.


### -param Timeout

Communications time-out value, from zero to 10. These values are not seconds; they represent a relative amount of time on a scale of zero to 10.


## -returns

## -remarks



In Windows XP and Windows 2000, during bind the RPC run time uses the shorter of a 15-minute call time-out, and the time-out set using the 
<b>RpcMgmtSetComTimeout</b> function. In exchanges subsequent to binding, the RPC run time uses only the time-out set in using the 
<b>RpcMgmtSetComTimeout</b> function. This option is ignored for <b>ncalrpc</b> and <b>ncadg_*</b> protocol sequences.

A client application calls 
<b>RpcMgmtSetComTimeout</b> to change the communications time-out value for a server binding handle. Depending on the protocol sequence for the specified binding handle, the time-out value acts only as a hint to the RPC run-time library. Each protocol sequence interprets this setting differently; for <b>ncacn_ip_tcp</b>, the value is used to turn on keep-alives for all calls. For example, for <b>ncacn_ip_tcp</b>, setting <i>Timeout</i> to zero instructs RPC to turn on keep-alives if a response isn't received in 60 seconds (the 60 second interval is implementation-specific and subject to change). In this situation, the client call is not timed out as long as the server us running; however, if the server fails or loses its IP address, RPC fails the call. The TCP time-out hint is used during connection establishment, as well as during request/reply exchanges.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Using the TCP time-out hint is the best practice for detecting failed servers.<p class="note">In Windows XP, keep-alives for a given connection are turned off when the server responds.

For convenience, constants are provided for certain values in the time-out range. For a list of the RPC-defined values that an application can use for the time-out argument, see 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Rpc/binding-time-out-constants">Binding Time-out Constants</a>.
