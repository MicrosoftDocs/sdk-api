# IAMDroppedFrames interface


## -description

The <b>IAMDroppedFrames</b> interface retrieves performance information from a video capture filter, including how many frames were dropped and how many were delivered. Applications can use this interface to determine capture performance at run-time.

## -inheritance

The <b>IAMDroppedFrames</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IAMDroppedFrames</b> also has these types of members:

## -remarks

Some filters that expose this interface do not implement the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nf-strmif-iamdroppedframes-getdroppedinfo">GetDroppedInfo</a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nf-strmif-iamdroppedframes-getaverageframesize">GetAverageFrameSize</a> method.

For Windows Driver Model (WDM) devices, the <a href="/windows/desktop/DirectShow/wdm-video-capture-filter">WDM Video Capture Filter</a> automatically exposes this interface if the WDM driver supports the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/stream/propsetid-vidcap-droppedframes">PROPSETID_VIDCAP_DROPPEDFRAMES</a> property set. For more information, see the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/gettingstarted/">Windows Driver Kit (WDK)</a> documentation.

The number of dropped frames is reported by the capture driver. This information is not directly correlated with any particular media sample, so it is not accurate on a per-frame basis, although it should be accurate over time.
