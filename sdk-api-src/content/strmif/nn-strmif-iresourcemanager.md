# IResourceManager interface


## -description

The <code>IResourceManager</code> interface resolves contentions for system resources.

The filter graph manager exposes this interface. Filters can use this interface to request resources that other objects are likely to use. For example, audio renderers use this interface to resolve contentions for the wave-output device, to enable sound to follow focus.

Applications will typically not use this interface.

An object can use this interface to resolve possible contentions between existing resources. The object registers the resource with the interface and then requests it whenever needed. The object should notify the filter graph manager whenever the user focus changes. The filter graph manager can then switch contended resources to the objects that have the focus of the user.

An object that uses this interface must implement the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nn-strmif-iresourceconsumer">IResourceConsumer</a> interface. <b>IResourceConsumer</b> provides a callback mechanism for the filter graph manager to notify the object when a resource becomes available, or when the object should release a resource that it acquired.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IResourceManager</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IResourceManager</b> also has these types of members:
