# IAMClockSlave interface


## -description

The <code>IAMClockSlave</code> interface controls the tolerance of an audio renderer when it is matching rates with another clock.

If the audio renderer is matching rates with another clock, it allows the audio to drift up to the amount of the specified tolerance. If the audio drifts too far ahead, the renderer drops samples; if it drifts too far behind, the renderer inserts silent gaps. This interface enables an application to change the tolerance from the default.

Setting a larger tolerance is likely to result in the audio stream becoming out of sync with the video stream. Setting a smaller tolerance can cause audio jitter. Therefore, changing the tolerance setting is not recommended, unless you have a specific reason to do so.

## -inheritance

The <b>IAMClockSlave</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IAMClockSlave</b> also has these types of members:
