# IMemInputPin::Receive


## -description

The <code>Receive</code> method receives the next media sample in the stream.

## -parameters

### -param pSample [in]

Pointer to the sample's <a href="/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nn-strmif-imediasample">IMediaSample</a> interface.

## -returns

Returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value. Possible values include those shown in the following table.

## -remarks

This method is synchronous and possibly blocking. The pin does one of the following:

<ul>
<li>Rejects the sample.</li>
<li>Returns immediately and processes the sample in a worker thread.</li>
<li>Processes the sample before returning.</li>
</ul>
In the last case, the method might block indefinitely. If this might happen, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nf-strmif-imeminputpin-receivecanblock">IMemInputPin::ReceiveCanBlock</a> method returns S_OK.

If the pin uses a worker thread to process the sample, it holds a reference count on the sample. In any case, the output pin cannot directly re-use this sample. It must call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nf-strmif-imemallocator-getbuffer">IMemAllocator::GetBuffer</a> method to obtain a new sample.

If this method returns S_FALSE or an error code, the upstream filter should stop sending samples until the graph stops or completes a flush operation. Typical reasons for an S_FALSE return value include:

<ul>
<li>The downstream pin is flushing; that is, it received a <b>BeginFlush</b> call and has not yet received an <b>EndFlush</b> call.</li>
<li>The downstream filter detected the end of the stream. (See <a href="/windows/desktop/DirectShow/end-of-stream-notifications">End-of-Stream Notifications</a>.)</li>
</ul>
