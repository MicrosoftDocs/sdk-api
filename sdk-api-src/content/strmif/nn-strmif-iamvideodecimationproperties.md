# IAMVideoDecimationProperties interface


## -description

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The <code>IAMVideoDecimationProperties</code> interface controls how the <a href="/windows/desktop/DirectShow/overlay-mixer-filter">Overlay Mixer</a> performs video decimation

If a video window is smaller than the native size of the video being displayed, the video renderer must <i>decimate</i> the incoming video—that is, scale the video down to the smaller size. Decimation can be performed in one of the following places.

<ul>
<li>The overlay hardware on the VGA chip.</li>
<li>The scaler built in to the video port (if the connection is through a video port).</li>
<li>The decoder supplying video to the renderer.</li>
</ul>
An application can call methods on this interface to select a particular decimation strategy, in order to optimize performance. However, most applications will have no occasion to use this interface. Unless your application is designed to support particular hardware, there is no reason to modify the Overlay Mixer filter's default behavior for decimation.

## -inheritance

The <b>IAMVideoDecimationProperties</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IAMVideoDecimationProperties</b> also has these types of members:
