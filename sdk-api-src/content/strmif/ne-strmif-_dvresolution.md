# _DVRESOLUTION enumeration


## -description

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Indicates the digital video (DV) decoding resolution.

## -enum-fields

### -field DVRESOLUTION_FULL:1000

Decode at full size.

### -field DVRESOLUTION_HALF:1001

Decode at half size.

### -field DVRESOLUTION_QUARTER:1002

Decode at quarter size.

### -field DVRESOLUTION_DC:1003

Decode at one-eighth size.

## -remarks

The decoding resolution depends on whether the current format is NTSC or PAL:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Enumeration</th>
<th>NTSC</th>
<th>PAL</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DVRESOLUTION_FULL</td>
<td>720 x 480</td>
<td>720 x 576</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DVRESOLUTION_HALF</td>
<td>360 x 240</td>
<td>360 x 288</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DVRESOLUTION_QUARTER</td>
<td>180 x 120</td>
<td>180 x 144</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DVRESOLUTION_DC</td>
<td>88 x 60</td>
<td>88 x 72</td>
</tr>
</table>
Â 

The following enumeration defined in strmif.h is equivalent to the <b>_DVRESOLUTION</b> enumeration. It is included for compatibility with existing applications.


``` syntax
enum _DVDECODERRESOLUTION {
    DVDECODERRESOLUTION_720x480     =   1000,
    DVDECODERRESOLUTION_360x240     =   1001,
    DVDECODERRESOLUTION_180x120     =   1002,
    DVDECODERRESOLUTION_88x60       =   1003
};
```
