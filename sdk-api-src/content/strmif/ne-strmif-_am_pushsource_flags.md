# _AM_PUSHSOURCE_FLAGS enumeration


## -description

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Indicates the behavior of a live source filter.

## -enum-fields

### -field AM_PUSHSOURCECAPS_INTERNAL_RM:0x1

The filter uses its own rate-matching mechanism; the renderer should therefore not attempt to match rates with this filter.

### -field AM_PUSHSOURCECAPS_NOT_LIVE:0x2

The filter is not live. Do not treat it as a live source, even though it exposes the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nn-strmif-iampushsource">IAMPushSource</a> interface.

### -field AM_PUSHSOURCECAPS_PRIVATE_CLOCK:0x4

The filter time stamps the samples using a private clock. The clock is not available to the rest of the graph through <a href="/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nn-strmif-ireferenceclock">IReferenceClock</a>.

### -field AM_PUSHSOURCEREQS_USE_STREAM_CLOCK:0x10000

Reserved; do not use.

### -field AM_PUSHSOURCEREQS_USE_CLOCK_CHAIN:0x20000

## -remarks

If no flags are set (the default case), the source filter is assumed to be live and not to perform any rate matching on its own.
