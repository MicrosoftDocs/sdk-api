# IResourceManager::SetFocus


## -description

The <code>SetFocus</code> method notifies the resource manager that a specified object has been given the focus of the user.

## -parameters

### -param pFocusObject [in]

Pointer to the object that has been given the user's focus.

## -returns

Returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value that depends on the implementation. <b>HRESULT</b> can be one of the following standard constants, or other values not listed.

## -remarks

In DirectShow, the object given the user's focus is typically a video renderer whose window has received the focus. The resource manager gives priority to requests for resources in the following order:

<ol>
<li>Requests made with the focus object specified in the <i>pFocusObject</i> parameter.</li>
<li>Requests whose focus object shares a common source filter.</li>
<li>Requests whose focus object shares a common filter graph.</li>
<li>Requests in the same process as the focus.</li>
</ol>
After a focus has been set, the resource manager must maintain a focus object until <a href="/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nf-strmif-iresourcemanager-releasefocus">ReleaseFocus</a> is called. That is, after calling this method, you must use <b>ReleaseFocus</b> before the <b>IUnknown</b> interface of the focus object becomes invalid, unless you can guarantee that <code>SetFocus</code> is called by a different object in the meantime. No reference count is held on the focus object.

The resource manager will hold this pointer until replaced or canceled, and will use it to resolve resource contention. It will use <b>QueryInterface</b> for the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nn-strmif-ibasefilter">IBaseFilter</a> interface at least and, if found, will use methods on that interface. It calls methods on <b>IBaseFilter</b> to decide which audio renderer to use if there are two (it will choose the one with a source filter common to the focus object), and also to determine if the two objects are within the same filter graph.
