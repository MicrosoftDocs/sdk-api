# ICaptureGraphBuilder2::AllocCapFile


## -description

The <code>AllocCapFile</code> method preallocates a capture file to a specified size. For best results, always capture to a defragmented, preallocated capture file that is larger than the size of the capture data.

## -parameters

### -param lpstr [in]

Pointer to a wide-character string that contains the name of the file to create or resize.

### -param dwlSize [in]

Size of the file to allocate, in bytes.

## -returns

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

## -remarks

This method fails if the file is read-only.

It is best to allocate as much space as possible—ideally, more than needed. However, this can result in a very large file that contains relatively little data. For example, a 1-gigabyte (GB) capture file might contain a few megabytes of captured video. Use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nf-strmif-icapturegraphbuilder2-copycapturefile">ICaptureGraphBuilder2::CopyCaptureFile</a> method to copy the data into a new file. That method copies only the data and ignores the empty portion of the original file.

If you use this method to preallocate the file, call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nf-strmif-ifilesinkfilter2-setmode">IFileSinkFilter2::SetMode</a> on the file-writer filter with the value zero. If the filter is set to AM_FILE_OVERWRITE, it will delete the preallocated file. Note that some file-writer filters do not support mode 0.
