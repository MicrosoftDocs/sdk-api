# IStreamBuilder::Backout


## -description

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The <code>Backout</code> method undoes steps taken in the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nf-strmif-istreambuilder-render">IStreamBuilder::Render</a> method. This includes disconnecting and removing any filters that were added inside <b>Render</b>.

## -parameters

### -param ppinOut [in]

Pointer to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nn-strmif-ipin">IPin</a> interface of this pin.

### -param pGraph [in]

Pointer to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nn-strmif-igraphbuilder">IGraphBuilder</a> interface of the Filter Graph Manager.

## -returns

Returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value. A return code of S_OK indicates to the graph builder that the disconnect was successful.

## -remarks

The following example shows how a filter would reverse the steps that are shown in the code example for the <b>IStreamBuilder::Render</b> method:

<div class="code"><span><table>
<tr>
<th>C++</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```
STDMETHODIMP CMyOutputPin::BackOut(IPin *pPin, IGraphBuilder *pGraph)
{
    CheckPointer(pPin, E_POINTER);
    CheckPointer(pGraph, E_POINTER);

    HRESULT hr = S_OK;
    if (m_Connected != NULL) // Pointer to the pin we're connected to.
    {
        // Find the filter that owns the pin connected to us.
        FILTER_INFO fi;
        hr = m_Connected-&gt;QueryFilterInfo(&amp;fi);
        if (SUCCEEDED(hr)) 
        {
            if (fi.pFilter != NULL) 
            {
                //  Disconnect the pins.
                pGraph-&gt;Disconnect(m_Connected);
                pGraph-&gt;Disconnect(pPin);
                // Remove the filter from the graph.
                pGraph-&gt;RemoveFilter(fi.pFilter);
                fi.pFilter-&gt;Release();
            } 
            else 
            {
                hr = E_UNEXPECTED;
            }
        }
    }
    return hr;
}
