# IFilterGraph interface


## -description

The <code>IFilterGraph</code> interface provides methods for building a filter graph. An application can use it to add filters to the graph, connect or disconnect filters, remove filters, and perform other basic operations. However, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nn-strmif-igraphbuilder">IGraphBuilder</a> interface inherits from this interface and provides additional methods that are more sophisticated. Therefore, applications should use <b>IGraphBuilder</b> rather than using <code>IFilterGraph</code> directly.

The filter graph manager implements this interface.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IFilterGraph</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IFilterGraph</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
