# IPinFlowControl interface


## -description

Blocks data flow from an active output pin. This interface is exposed by output pins that can reconnect dynamically. Use this interface to start a dynamic reconnection within the filter graph. For more information, see <a href="/windows/desktop/DirectShow/dynamic-graph-building">Dynamic Graph Building</a>.

<b>Filter developers: </b>Parser and capture filters that support dynamic reconnection should support this interface on their output pins. Generally, other types of filters do not need to implement this interface.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IPinFlowControl</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IPinFlowControl</b> also has these types of members:
