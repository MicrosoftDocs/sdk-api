# IAMExtTransport::GetCapability


## -description



The <code>GetCapability</code> method retrieves the general capabilities of the transport.




## -parameters




### -param Capability [in]

Specifies the capability to check. See Remarks for more information.


### -param pValue [out]

Pointer to a variable that receives a <b>long</b> integer. See Remarks for more information.


### -param pdblValue [out]

Pointer to a variable that receives a <b>double</b>. See Remarks for more information.


## -returns



When this method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



The <i>Capability</i> parameter is a flag that specifies which capability to check. The method returns the result either in the <i>pValue</i> parameter or in the <i>pdblValue</i> parameter, depending on the capability flag.

For the following flags, the method returns the value OATRUE or OAFALSE in the <i>pValue</i> parameter. The value OATRUE indicates that the capability is present, while the value OAFALSE indicates it is absent.
