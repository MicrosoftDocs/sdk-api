# IAMLatency interface


## -description

The <code>IAMLatency</code> interface reports the amount of latency that a filter introduces into the graph. Latency is defined as the time that it takes the filter to process a sample. For a source filter, latency is the filter's maximum buffer size, measured in time. For example, a video capture filter that buffers one frame at 30 frames per second introduces a latency of about 33 milliseconds.

Currently, there is no support for using this interface by itself. A source filter that streams live or real-time data should implement the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nn-strmif-iampushsource">IAMPushSource</a> interface, which inherits from this interface.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IAMLatency</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IAMLatency</b> also has these types of members:
