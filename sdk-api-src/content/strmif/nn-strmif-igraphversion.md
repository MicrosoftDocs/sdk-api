# IGraphVersion interface


## -description



The <code>IGraphVersion</code> interface is implemented on the Filter Graph Manager to provide a way for plug-in distributors and applications to know when the graph has changed. If the graph has changed, and the application or plug-in distributor has an interface on a particular filter or pin, it should requery the graph to see if its pointers are still valid, or if there are new ones it should use.
