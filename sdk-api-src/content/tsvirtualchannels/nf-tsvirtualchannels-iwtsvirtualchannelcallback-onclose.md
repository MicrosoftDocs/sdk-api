# IWTSVirtualChannelCallback::OnClose


## -description

Notifies the user that the channel has been closed. There are three ways for the channel to 
    be closed:
<ul>
<li>The user has called the 
     <a href="/windows/desktop/api/tsvirtualchannels/nf-tsvirtualchannels-iwtsvirtualchannel-close">IWTSVirtualChannel::Close</a> method.</li>
<li>The Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) client has disconnected from the Remote Desktop Session Host (RD Session Host) 
     server.</li>
<li>The server has called the 
     <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wtsapi32/nf-wtsapi32-wtsvirtualchannelclose">WTSVirtualChannel::Close</a> method on the 
     channel.</li>
</ul>Regardless of how the channel has been closed, there is no need to call 
    <a href="/windows/desktop/api/tsvirtualchannels/nf-tsvirtualchannels-iwtsvirtualchannel-close">IWTSVirtualChannel::Close()</a> when this call 
    is received. If such a call is made, it is possible that if the plug-in is running out of process, that a call to 
    <b>IWTSVirtualChannel::Close()</b> may cause a 
    deadlock. A deadlock may occur because the caller of 
    <b>OnClose()</b> holds a channel list 
    lock, and the <b>Close()</b> method will try to 
    acquire the same lock on a different thread.

## -parameters

## -returns

Returns <b>S_OK</b> on success. Results in no action if the call fails.
