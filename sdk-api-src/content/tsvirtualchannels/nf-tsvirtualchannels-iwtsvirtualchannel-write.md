# IWTSVirtualChannel::Write


## -description


Starts a write request on the channel. All writes are considered asynchronous. Calling this method copies the contents of <i>pBuffer</i> and returns immediately, so  the buffer can be reclaimed. Because of the memory copy, too many <b>Write()</b> calls may result in allocating too much memory by the client.

A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tsvirtualchannels/nf-tsvirtualchannels-iwtsvirtualchannel-close">Close()</a> call on this channel will cancel any pending writes.


## -parameters




### -param cbSize [in]

The size, in bytes, of the buffer to which to write.


### -param pBuffer [in]

A pointer to a buffer on the channel to which to write the data. You can reuse this buffer as soon as the call returns.


### -param pReserved [in, optional]

Reserved for future use. The value must be <b>NULL</b>.


## -returns



Returns <b>S_OK</b> if successful.
