# Provider::Flush


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/provider/nl-provider-provider">Provider</a> class 
    is part of the WMI Provider Framework which is now considered in final state, and no further development, 
    enhancements, or updates will be available for non-security related issues affecting these libraries. The 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/wmi_v2/windows-management-infrastructure">MI APIs</a> should be used for all new 
    development.]

The <b>Flush</b> method is called by the provider framework to delete all unnecessary memory in use by the provider. Because your provider may be called again after a call to <b>Flush</b>, you must re-create any objects released by <b>Flush</b>. If you override this method, you should call the parent object's <b>Flush</b> method to release any framework memory associated with your provider.


## -parameters






## -remarks



Override this method only if your framework provider allocates memory that can be flushed. If your provider chooses to override, include a call to <b>Provider::Flush</b> in the provider's implementation.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Because your provider may be called after a call to <b>Flush</b>, you must be prepared to re-create any items released by the call to <b>Flush</b>.</div>
