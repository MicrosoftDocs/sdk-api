<li>DHCP_PROB_RELEASE</li>
<li>DHCP_PROB_NACKED</li>
</ul>See Remarks for more information on these events. The 
<b>DhcpAddressDelHook</b> function is implemented by a third-party DLL that registers for notification of significant Microsoft DHCP Server events. The 
<b>DhcpAddressDelHook</b> function should not block.
