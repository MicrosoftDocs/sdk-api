# LPDHCP_NEWPKT callback function


## -description


The 
<b>DhcpNewPktHook</b> function is called by Microsoft DHCP Server shortly after it receives a DHCP packet slated for processing. Since the 
<b>DhcpNewPktHook</b> function call is in the critical path for Microsoft DHCP Server processing, this function should execute and return as quickly as possible or performance will be impacted.

The 
<b>DhcpNewPktHook</b> function is implemented by a third-party DLL that registers for notification of significant Microsoft DHCP Server events.


## -parameters




### -param *Packet [in, out]

Pointer to a 4Kb character buffer that contains the packet.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Writing to this buffer directly is not recommended.</div>
<div> </div>

### -param *PacketSize [in, out]

Pointer to the size of the <i>Packet</i> parameter.


### -param IpAddress [in]

Pointer to the IP address of the socket on which the packet was received. The IP address is in host order.


### -param Reserved [in]

Reserved for future use.


### -param *PktContext [in, out]

Pointer provided by the third-party DLL, and used by Microsoft DHCP Server in future references to this specific packet. Third-party DLLs interested in such tracking are responsible for providing and tracking this packet context.


### -param ProcessIt [out]

Flag identifying whether Microsoft DHCP Server should continue processing the packet. Set to <b>TRUE</b> to indicate processing should proceed. Set to <b>FALSE</b> to have Microsoft DHCP Server drop the packet.


## -returns



Return values are defined by the application providing the callback.




## -remarks



If useful, third-party DLLs can modify the <i>Packet</i> buffer, or return a new packet buffer through appropriate modification of the <i>Packet</i> and <i>PacketSize</i> parameters.

If a third-party DLL needs to keep track of a given packet and its progress through Microsoft DHCP Server, it can provide a packet context in <i>PktContext</i>, and use internal structures that track the packet's progress through its DHCP processing. A context provided in <i>PktContext</i> will be passed as a parameter to many other DHCP Server API functions, enabling identification.
