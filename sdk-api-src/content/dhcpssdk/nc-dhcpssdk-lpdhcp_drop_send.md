# LPDHCP_DROP_SEND callback function


## -description

## -parameters

### -param *Packet [in, out]

Pointer to a buffer, 4Kb in size,  that contains the packet.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Writing to this buffer directly is not recommended.</div>
<div> </div>

### -param *PacketSize [in, out]

Pointer to the size of the <i>Packet</i> parameter, in bytes.

### -param ControlCode [in]

Control code that specifies the reason for dropping. See Remarks.

### -param IpAddress [in]

Internet Protocol (IP) address of the socket on which the packet was received. The IP address is in host order.

### -param Reserved [in]

Reserved for future use.

### -param PktContext [in]

Context identifying the packet, as provided in the <i>PktContext</i> parameter of a previous 
<a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/dhcpssdk/nc-dhcpssdk-lpdhcp_newpkt">DhcpNewPktHook</a> function call.

## -returns

Return values are defined by the application providing the callback.

## -remarks

The 
<b>DhcpPktDropHook</b> function is called by Microsoft DHCP Server when a DHCP packet is dropped, or a packet is completely processed. The 
<b>DhcpPktDropHook</b> is implemented by a third-party DLL that registers for notification of significant Microsoft DHCP Server events.

The 
<b>DhcpPktDropHook</b> function should not block.

Third-party DLLs that register for notification of this event should be prepared to have their 
<b>DhcpPktDropHook</b> function called multiple times for each packet. If a packet is dropped by Microsoft DHCP Server, this function is called twice for that packet: once to notify that the packet was dropped, and again to identify that the packet was completely processed.

The following table defines the possible control codes returned in the <i>ControlCode</i> parameter.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Control code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DHCP_DROP_DUPLICATE</td>
<td>The packet is a duplicate of another received by the DHCP server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DHCP_DROP_NOMEM</td>
<td>There is not enough memory available to process the packet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DHCP_DROP_INTERNAL_ERROR</td>
<td>An unexpected internal error has occurred.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DHCP_DROP_TIMEOUT</td>
<td>The packet is too old to process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DHCP_DROP_UNAUTH</td>
<td>The server is not authorized to process this packet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DHCP_DROP_PAUSED</td>
<td>The server is paused.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DHCP_DROP_NO_SUBNETS</td>
<td>There are no subnets configured, therefore there is no point in processing the packet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DHCP_DROP_INVALID</td>
<td>The packet is invalid, or it was received on an invalid socket.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DHCP_DROP_WRONG_SERVER</td>
<td>The packet was sent to the wrong DHCP Server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DHCP_DROP_NOADDRESS</td>
<td>There is no address to offer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DHCP_DROP_PROCESSED</td>
<td>The packet has been processed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DHCP_DROP_GEN_FAILURE</td>
<td>An unknown error has occurred.</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

The 
<b>DhcpPktSendHook</b> function is called by Microsoft DHCP Server directly before Microsoft DHCP Server sends a response to a client. Registering for notification of 
<b>DhcpPktSendHook</b> enables third-party developers to alter the response of the Microsoft DHCP Server by manipulation of the packet pointers. The 
<b>DhcpPktSendHook</b> is implemented by a third-party DLL that registers for notification of significant Microsoft DHCP Server events.

The 
<b>DhcpPktSendHook</b> function should not block.

The 
<b>DhcpPktSendHook</b> function should not block.
