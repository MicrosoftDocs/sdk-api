## -description

An enumeration of the set of supported resources.

## -enum-fields

### -field ACTIVITY_COORDINATOR_RESOURCE_USER_IDLE

Represents how actively the user is engaged with the device, and hence how likely activity is to interfere with that use.

### -field ACTIVITY_COORDINATOR_RESOURCE_POWER

Represents the current energy state of the system.

### -field ACTIVITY_COORDINATOR_RESOURCE_NETWORK

Represents the current network state of the system.

### -field ACTIVITY_COORDINATOR_RESOURCE_CPU

Represents the current CPU state of the system.

### -field ACTIVITY_COORDINATOR_RESOURCE_MEMORY

Represents the current memory state of the system.

### -field ACTIVITY_COORDINATOR_RESOURCE_SYSTEM_DISK

Represents the current system-disk state of the system.

System-disk refers to the drive where the operating system is installed.

### -field ACTIVITY_COORDINATOR_RESOURCE_GPU

Represents GPU availability. Includes GPU utilization.

## -remarks

### Condition information for resources

| Resource | Good Condition | Medium Condition |
|-----|-----|-----|
| USER_IDLE | User is inactive and/or background activities are highly unlikely to interfere with user experiences. | User may be active. Background activities are unlikely to interfere with highly sensitive experiences. |
| POWER | Energy consumption is highly unlikely to impact user experience. | Energy consumption may impact user experience but will not critically degrade it. Potential impacts may include battery life. |
| NETWORK | Internet access is available; activities highly unlikely to impact user experience. | Internet access is available, but consumption may impact the user. Potential impacts may include consuming limited and/or paid bandwidth. |
| CPU | Additional CPU usage is highly unlikely to interfere with user experiences. | Additional CPU usage may interfere with system performance but will not critically degrade it. |
| MEMORY | Additional memory usage is highly unlikely to interfere with user experiences. | Additional memory usage may interfere with system performance but will not critically degrade it. |
| SYSTEM_DISK | Additional system-disk usage is highly unlikely to interfere with user experiences. | Additional system-disk usage may interfere with system performance but will not critically degrade it. |
| GPU | Additional GPU usage is highly unlikely to interfere with user experiences. | Additional GPU usage may interfere with resource-intensive, visual user experiences such as gaming, video streaming, etc. |
