### -field vendorID

Type: **uint32_t\***

The PCI ID or ACPI ID of the adapter's hardware vendor. If this value is less than or equal to 0xFFFF, it is a PCI ID; otherwise, it is an ACPI ID.

### -field deviceID

Type: **uint32_t\***

The PCI ID or ACPI ID of the adapter's hardware device. If <b>vendorID</b> is a PCI ID, it is also a PCI ID; otherwise, it is an ACPI ID.

### -field subSysID

Type: **uint32_t\***

The PCI ID or ACPI ID of the adapter's hardware subsystem. If <b>vendorID</b> is a PCI ID, it is also a PCI ID; otherwise, it is an ACPI ID.

### -field revision
