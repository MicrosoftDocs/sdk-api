## -description

Defines constants that specify kinds of DXCore adapter states. Pass one of these constants to the [IDXCoreAdapter::QueryState](/windows/win32/dxcore/dxcore_interface/nf-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapter-querystate) method to retrieve the adapter state item for a state kind; pass a constant to the [IDXCoreAdapter::SetState](/windows/win32/dxcore/dxcore_interface/nf-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapter-setstate) method to set an adapter's info for a state item.

## -enum-fields

### -field IsDriverUpdateInProgress:0

Specifies the <em>IsDriverUpdateInProgress</em> adapter state, which when `true` indicates that a driver update has been initiated on the adapter but it has not yet completed. If the driver update has already completed, then the adapter will have been invalidated, and your [QueryState](/windows/win32/dxcore/dxcore_interface/nf-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapter-querystate) call will return a <b>HRESULT</b> of <b>DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED</b>.

When calling [QueryState](/windows/win32/dxcore/dxcore_interface/nf-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapter-querystate), the <em>IsDriverUpdateInProgress</em> state item has type <b>uint8_t</b>, representing a Boolean value.

<b>Important</b>. This state item is not supported for [SetState](/windows/win32/dxcore/dxcore_interface/nf-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapter-setstate).

### -field AdapterMemoryBudget:1

Specifies the <em>AdapterMemoryBudget</em> adapter state, which retrieves or requests the adapter memory budget on the adapter.

When calling [QueryState](/windows/win32/dxcore/dxcore_interface/nf-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapter-querystate), the <em>AdapterMemoryBudget</em> adapter state has type <a href="/windows/win32/api/dxcore_interface/ns-dxcore_interface-dxcoreadaptermemorybudgetnodesegmentgroup">DXCoreAdapterMemoryBudgetNodeSegmentGroup</a> for *inputStateDetails*, and type <a href="/windows/win32/api/dxcore_interface/ns-dxcore_interface-dxcoreadaptermemorybudget">DXCoreAdapterMemoryBudget</a> for *outputBuffer*.

<b>Important</b>. This state item is not supported for [SetState](/windows/win32/dxcore/dxcore_interface/nf-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapter-setstate).

### -field AdapterMemoryUsageBytes:2

This query takes Physical Adapter Index and Dedicated vs. Shared as input; and outputs the Committed and Resident Memory Dedicated or Shared portions of GPU Memory, respectively.

### -field AdapterMemoryUsageByProcessBytes:3

This query takes Engine ID, Physical Adapter Index, and Process Handle as input; and outputs Committed Memory and Resident Memory on Dedicated or Shared portions of GPU Memory, respectively.

### -field AdapterEngineRunningTimeMicroseconds:4

This query takes Engine ID and Physical Adapter Index as input; and outputs Engine Running Time as output.

### -field AdapterEngineRunningTimeByProcessMicroseconds:5

This query takes Engine ID, Physical Adapter Index, and Process Handle as input; and outputs Engine Running Time as output.

### -field AdapterTemperatureCelsius:6

This query takes Physical Adapter Index as input, and outputs Current GPU Temperature in Degrees Celsius.

### -field AdapterInUseProcessCount:7

This returns the number of processes using this adapter, and the PIDs in it, respectively.

### -field AdapterInUseProcessSet:8

This returns the number of processes using this adapter, and the PIDs in it, respectively.

### -field AdapterEngineFrequencyHertz:9

TBD

### -field AdapterMemoryFrequencyHertz:10

TBD
