## -description

Retrieves the current state of the specified item on the adapter. Before calling **QueryState** for a property type, call [IsQueryStateSupported](/windows/win32/api/dxcore_interface/nf-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapter-isquerystatesupported) to confirm that querying the state kind is available for this adapter and operating system (OS).

## -parameters

### -param state

Type: **[DXCoreAdapterState](/windows/win32/api/dxcore_interface/ne-dxcore_interface-dxcoreadapterstate)**

The kind of state item on the adapter whose state you wish to retrieve. See the table in [DXCoreAdapterState](/windows/win32/api/dxcore_interface/ne-dxcore_interface-dxcoreadapterstate) for more info about each adapter state kind.

### -param inputStateDetailsSize

Type: **size_t**

The size, in bytes, of the input state details buffer that you (optionally) allocate and provide in *inputStateDetails*.

### -param inputStateDetails [in]

Type: **void const\***

An optional pointer to a constant input state details buffer that you allocate in your application, containing any information about your request that's required for the state kind you specify in *state*. See the table in [DXCoreAdapterState](/windows/win32/api/dxcore_interface/ne-dxcore_interface-dxcoreadapterstate) for more info about any input buffer requirement for a given state kind.

### -param outputBufferSize

Type: **size_t**

The size, in bytes, of the output buffer that you allocate and provide in *outputBuffer*.

### -param outputBuffer [out]

Type: **void\***

A pointer to an output buffer that you allocate in your application, and that the function fills in. See the table in [DXCoreAdapterState](/windows/win32/api/dxcore_interface/ne-dxcore_interface-dxcoreadapterstate) for more info about the output buffer requirement for a given state kind.

## -returns

Type: **[HRESULT](/windows/win32/com/structure-of-com-error-codes)**

If the function succeeds, it returns **S_OK**. Otherwise, it returns an [**HRESULT**](/windows/win32/com/structure-of-com-error-codes) [error code](/windows/win32/com/com-error-codes-10).

|Return value|Description|
|-|-|
|DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED|The adapter is no longer in a valid state.|
|DXGI_ERROR_INVALID_CALL|The state kind specified in *state* is not recognized by this operating system (OS). Call [IsQueryStateSupported](/windows/win32/api/dxcore_interface/nf-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapter-isquerystatesupported) to confirm that querying the state kind is available for this adapter and operating system (OS).|
|DXGI_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED|The state kind specified in *state* is not supported by the adapter. Call [IsQueryStateSupported](/windows/win32/api/dxcore_interface/nf-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapter-isquerystatesupported) to confirm that querying the state kind is available for this adapter and operating system (OS).|
|E_INVALIDARG|An insufficient buffer size is provided for *outputBuffer* (or for *inputStateDetails* where an input state details buffer is necessary).|
|E_POINTER|`nullptr` was provided for *outputBuffer* (or for *inputStateDetails* where an input state details buffer is necessary).|

## -remarks

See [DXCoreAdapterState](/windows/win32/api/dxcore_interface/ne-dxcore_interface-dxcoreadapterstate) for more info about each adapter state kind, and what inputs and outputs are used. This function zeros out the *outputBuffer* buffer prior to filling it in.
