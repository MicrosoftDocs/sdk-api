### -param punk2 [in]

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a>*</b>

A pointer to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface of the image list that contains the second image. 			


### -param i2 [in]

A value of type <b>int</b> that contains the index of the second existing image. 
				


### -param dx [in]

Type: <b>int</b>

A value of type <b>int</b>  that contains the x-component of the offset of the second image relative to the first image. 
				


### -param dy [in]

### -param riid [out]

Type: <b>REFIID</b>

An IID of the interface for the new image list.


### -param ppv [out]

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">PVOID</a>*</b>

A raw pointer to the interface for the new image list.


## -returns



Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">HRESULT</a></b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



The new image consists of the second image drawn transparently over the first. 	The mask for the new image is obtained by combining the masks of the two existing images with the bitwise OR operator.

To use <b>IImageList::Merge</b>, specify Comctl32.dll version 6 in the manifest. For more information on manifests, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Controls/cookbook-overview">Enabling Visual Styles</a>.
