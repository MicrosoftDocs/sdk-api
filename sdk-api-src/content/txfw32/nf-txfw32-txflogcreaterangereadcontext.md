## -description

<p class="CCE_Message">[Microsoft strongly recommends developers utilize alternative means to achieve your 
    applicationâ€™s needs. Many scenarios that TxF was developed for can be achieved through simpler and more readily 
    available techniques. Furthermore, TxF may not be available in future versions of Microsoft Windows. For more 
    information, and alternatives to TxF, please see 
    <a href="/windows/desktop/FileIO/deprecation-of-txf">Alternatives to using Transactional NTFS</a>.]

Creates a context that is required to read any replication records.  In order to recover resources, the context must later be closed by calling TxfLogDestroyReadContext. Since the resources are allocated by a user-mode process, if that routine is not called, the resources will be recovered automatically when the process hosting the DLL terminates.
