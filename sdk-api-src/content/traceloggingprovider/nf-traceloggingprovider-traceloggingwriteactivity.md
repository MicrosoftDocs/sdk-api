# TraceLoggingWriteActivity macro

## -description

Emits a TraceLogging event with specified activity IDs.

## -parameters

### -param hProvider [in]

The handle of the
[TraceLogging provider](./nf-traceloggingprovider-tracelogging_define_provider.md)
to use for writing the event.

### -param eventName [in]

A short and unique name to use for identifying the event. This must be a string
literal and not a variable. It cannot have any embedded `'\0'` characters.

### -param pActivityId [in, optional]

The activity ID for the event, or NULL to use the default.

### -param pRelatedActivityId [in, optional]

The related activity ID for the event, or NULL for no related activity ID.

### -param __VA_ARGS__ [in, optional]

Up to 99 additional parameters to configure or add fields to the event. Each
parameter must be one of the
[TraceLogging Wrapper Macros](/windows/win32/tracelogging/tracelogging-wrapper-macros),
such as [TraceLoggingLevel](./nf-traceloggingprovider-tracelogginglevel.md),
[TraceLoggingKeyword](./nf-traceloggingprovider-traceloggingkeyword.md), or
[TraceLoggingValue](./nf-traceloggingprovider-traceloggingvalue.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ProviderId, Level and Keyword are the primary means for filtering
> events. Other kinds of filtering are possible but have much higher overhead.
> Always assign a non-zero level and keyword to every event.

## -remarks

Each invocation of the **TraceLoggingWriteActivity** macro expands to the code
necessary to write an event to ETW through the specified provider handle.

- **TraceLoggingWriteActivity** checks whether the specified provider is
  registered. If the provider is not
  [registered](./nf-traceloggingprovider-traceloggingregister.md),
  **TraceLoggingWriteActivity** does nothing.
- **TraceLoggingWriteActivity** checks whether any consumer is listening for the
  event, as if by calling
  [**TraceLoggingProviderEnabled**](./nf-traceloggingprovider-traceloggingproviderenabled.md).
  If no consumer is listening for the event, **TraceLoggingWriteActivity** does
  nothing.
- Otherwise, **TraceLoggingWriteActivity** evaluates the runtime expressions
  specified in the arguments, saves the results, packs the necessary data into
  an event, and calls
  [EventWriteTransfer](../evntprov/nf-evntprov-eventwritetransfer.md) to send
  the event to ETW.

The generated event will be constructed as follows:

- The event's provider ID, provider name, and provider group will come from the
  _hProvider_ parameter.
- The event's name will come from the _eventName_ parameter.
- The event's activity ID will come from the _pActivityId_ parameter. If
  _pActivityId_ is NULL, user-mode events will use the thread's implicit
  activity ID and kernel-mode events will use GUID_NULL.
- The event's related activity ID will come from the _pRelatedActivityId_
  parameter. If _pRelatedActivityId_ is NULL, the event will not have a related
  activity ID.
- The event's level will come from the
  [TraceLoggingLevel](./nf-traceloggingprovider-tracelogginglevel.md) argument.
  If no TraceLoggingLevel argument is present, the event's level will be 5
  (WINEVENT_LEVEL_VERBOSE). If more than one TraceLoggingLevel argument is present,
  the last argument will be used. To enable effective event filtering, always
  assign a meaningful non-zero level to every event.
- The event's keyword will come from the
  [TraceLoggingKeyword](./nf-traceloggingprovider-traceloggingkeyword.md)
  argument. If no TraceLoggingKeyword argument is present, the event's keyword
  will be 0 (NONE). If more than one TraceLoggingKeyword argument is present,
  the values will be OR'ed together. To enable effective event filtering, always
  assign a meaningful non-zero keyword to every event.
- Other event attributes may be set by arguments such as
  [TraceLoggingOpcode](./nf-traceloggingprovider-traceloggingopcode.md),
  [TraceLoggingDescription](./nf-traceloggingprovider-traceloggingdescription.md),
  [TraceLoggingEventTag](./nf-traceloggingprovider-traceloggingeventtag.md), or
  [TraceLoggingChannel](./nf-traceloggingprovider-traceloggingchannel.md).
- Event fields can be grouped using
  [TraceLoggingStruct](./nf-traceloggingprovider-traceloggingstruct.md).
- Event fields are added by field arguments like
  [TraceLoggingValue](./nf-traceloggingprovider-traceloggingvalue.md),
  TraceLoggingInt32, TraceLoggingHResult, TraceLoggingString, etc. See
  [TraceLogging Wrapper Macros](/windows/desktop/tracelogging/tracelogging-wrapper-macros)
  for details.

For example:

```c
TraceLoggingWriteActivity(
    g_hProvider,
    "MyEvent1",
    &myActivityGuid,
    NULL, // no related activity ID
    TraceLoggingLevel(WINEVENT_LEVEL_WARNING), // Levels defined in <winmeta.h>
    TraceLoggingKeyword(MyNetworkingKeyword), // Provider-defined categories
    TraceLoggingHResult(hr, "NetStatus")); // Adds a "NetStatus" field.
```

An invocation of
`TraceLoggingWriteActivity(hProvider, "EventName", aid, rid, args...)` can be
thought of as expanding to code like the following:

```c
if (TraceLoggingProviderEnabled(hProvider, eventLevel, eventKeyword))
{
    static const metadata = { GetMetadataFromArgs(args...) };
    EVENT_DATA_DESCRIPTOR data[N] = { GetDataFromArgs(args...) };
    EventWriteTransfer(etwHandle, metadata.desc, aid, rid, N, data);
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Each **TraceLoggingWriteActivity** macro automatically checks
> [**TraceLoggingProviderEnabled**](./nf-traceloggingprovider-traceloggingproviderenabled.md)
> so the event will only be written if a consumer is listening for events from
> the provider. As a result, it is usually unnecessary to directly call
> **TraceLoggingProviderEnabled**. Any runtime expressions in `args...` will be
> evaluated if and only if the event is enabled. Runtime expressions will not be
> evaluated more than once.

If generating complex events, you might get a compiler error indicating that the
line is too long or that the compiler is out of heap space. This occurs when the
**TraceLoggingWriteActivity** macro expands to a line longer than can be
supported by the compiler. If this happens you will need to simplify your event.

The **TraceLoggingWriteActivity** macro uses an array of
[EVENT_DATA_DESCRIPTOR](../evntprov/ns-evntprov-event_data_descriptor.md) to
transfer data to ETW. The maximum number of descriptors accepted by ETW is 128.
Since each parameter may require the use of 0, 1, or 2 descriptors, it is
possible to hit the data descriptor limit (128) before hitting the argument
limit (99).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Try to avoid large events. ETW is primarily designed for handling
> small events. **TraceLoggingWriteActivity** will silently drop any event that
> is too large. The event's size is based on the total of the event's headers
> (added by the ETW runtime), metadata (i.e. provider name, event name, field
> names, field types), and data (field values). If the event's total size is
> greater than 65535 or if the consumer session is using a buffer size smaller
> than the event's size, the event will not be recorded.

A call to
[**TraceLoggingWrite**](./nf-traceloggingprovider-traceloggingwrite.md) is the
same as a call to **TraceLoggingWriteActivity** with NULL for the _pActivityId_
and _pRelatedActivityId_ parameters. Use **TraceLoggingWriteActivity** if you
need to specify activity IDs for an event.

See [EventWriteTransfer](../evntprov/nf-evntprov-eventwritetransfer.md) for
information about the semantics of the _ActivityId_ and _RelatedActivityId_
parameters.

See [EventActivityIdControl](../evntprov/nf-evntprov-eventactivityidcontrol.md)
for information about writing activities in ETW.

See [TraceLoggingActivity](../traceloggingactivity/index.md) for C++ classes
that help manage TraceLogging ETW activities.
