## -description

Unregisters a TraceLogging provider.

## -parameters

### -param hProvider

A handle to the provider to unregister.

## -remarks

You must unregister your provider before it is unloaded or deleted. Otherwise, the ETW callback routines will fail and have unpredictable results.

In regards to thread safety, do not overlap calls to [**TraceLoggingRegister**](nf-traceloggingprovider-traceloggingregister.md) and **TraceLoggingUnregister** with calls to other TraceLogging APIs using the same provider handle. In particular, the call to **TraceLoggingRegister** must return before you call **TraceLoggingWrite** or **TraceLoggingUnregister**. Calls to other APIs must also complete before you call **TraceLoggingUnregister**.

In addition, you must not call **TraceLoggingRegister** on a handle that is already registered or for a handle that could be in the process of being registered or unregistered on another thread.
