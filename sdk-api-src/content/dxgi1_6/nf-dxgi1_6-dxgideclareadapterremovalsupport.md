# DXGIDeclareAdapterRemovalSupport function


## -description

Allows a process to indicate that it's resilient to any of its graphics devices being removed.

## -parameters

## -returns

Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

Returns <b>S_OK</b> if successful; an error code otherwise. If this function is called after device creation, it returns <b>DXGI_ERROR_INVALID_CALL</b>. If this is not the first time that this function is called, it returns <b>DXGI_ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS</b>. For a full list of error codes, see <a href="/windows/desktop/direct3ddxgi/dxgi-error">DXGI_ERROR</a>.

## -remarks

This function is graphics API-agonistic, meaning that apps running on other APIs, such as OpenGL and Vulkan, would also apply.

This function should be called once per process and before any device creation.
