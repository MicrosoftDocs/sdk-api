# IWICBitmapCodecInfo::GetDeviceManufacturer


## -description

Retrieves the name of the device manufacture associated with the codec.

## -parameters

### -param cchDeviceManufacturer [in]

Type: <b>UINT</b>

The size of the device manufacture's name. Use <code>0</code> on first call to determine needed buffer size.

### -param wzDeviceManufacturer [in, out]

Type: <b>WCHAR*</b>

Receives the device manufacture's name. Use <code>NULL</code> on first call to determine needed buffer size.

### -param pcchActual [out]

Type: <b>UINT*</b>

The actual buffer size needed to retrieve the device manufacture's name.

## -returns

Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

## -remarks

The usage pattern for this method is a two call process.
            The first call retrieves the buffer size needed to retrieve the full color management version number by calling it with <i>cchDeviceManufacturer</i> set to <code>0</code> and <i>wzDeviceManufacturer</i> set to <code>NULL</code>.
            This call sets <i>pcchActual</i> to the buffer size needed.
            Once the needed buffer size is determined, a second <b>GetDeviceManufacturer</b> call with <i>cchDeviceManufacturer</i> set to the buffer size and <i>wzDeviceManufacturer</i> set to a buffer of the appropriate size will retrieve the pixel formats.
