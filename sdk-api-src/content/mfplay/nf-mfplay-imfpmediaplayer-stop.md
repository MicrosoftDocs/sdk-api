# IMFPMediaPlayer::Stop


## -description

\[The feature associated with this page, MFPlay, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer) and  [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** and **IMFMediaEngine** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

## -remarks

This method completes asynchronously.  When the operation completes, the application's <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mfplay/nf-mfplay-imfpmediaplayercallback-onmediaplayerevent">IMFPMediaPlayerCallback::OnMediaPlayerEvent</a> callback method is invoked. The event type is <b>MFP_EVENT_TYPE_STOP</b>.

The current media item is still valid. After playback stops, the playback position resets to the beginning of the current media item.
