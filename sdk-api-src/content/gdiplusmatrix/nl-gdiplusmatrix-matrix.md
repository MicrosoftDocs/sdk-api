# Matrix class


## -description


A <b>Matrix</b> object represents a 3
			×3 matrix that, in turn, represents an affine transformation. A <b>Matrix</b> object stores only six of the 9 numbers in a 3
			×3 matrix because all 3
			×3 matrices that represent affine transformations have the same third column (0, 0, 1).
