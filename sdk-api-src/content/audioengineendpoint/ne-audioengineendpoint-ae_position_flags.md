# AE_POSITION_FLAGS enumeration


## -description


Defines constants for the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/audioengineendpoint/ns-audioengineendpoint-ae_current_position">AE_CURRENT_POSITION</a> structure. These constants describe the degree of validity of the current position.


## -enum-fields




### -field POSITION_INVALID

The position is not valid and must not be used.


### -field POSITION_DISCONTINUOUS

The position is valid; however, there has been
    a disruption such as a glitch or state transition.
    This current position is not correlated with the previous position. The start of a stream should not reflect a discontinuity.


### -field POSITION_CONTINUOUS

The position is valid. The previous packet and the current packet are both synchronized with the timeline.


### -field POSITION_QPC_ERROR

The quality performance counter (QPC) timer value associated with this position is not accurate. This flag is set when a position error is encountered and the implementation is unable to compute an accurate QPC value that correlates with the position.


## -remarks



The Remote Desktop Services AudioEndpoint API is for use in Remote Desktop scenarios; it is not for client applications.
