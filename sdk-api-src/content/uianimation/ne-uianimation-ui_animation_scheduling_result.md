               For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/uianimation/nf-uianimation-iuianimationprioritycomparison-haspriority">IUIAnimationPriorityComparison::HasPriority</a>.

               the storyboard is already scheduled.


### -field UI_ANIMATION_SCHEDULING_SUCCEEDED

Scheduling succeeded.


### -field UI_ANIMATION_SCHEDULING_DEFERRED

## -remarks




<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/uianimation/nf-uianimation-iuianimationstoryboard-schedule">IUIAnimationStoryboard::Schedule</a> returns UI_ANIMATION_SCHEDULING_DEFERRED only if the application attempts to schedule a storyboard during a callback to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/uianimation/nf-uianimation-iuianimationstoryboardeventhandler-onstoryboardstatuschanged">IUIAnimationStoryboardEventHandler::OnStoryboardStatusChanged</a>.
