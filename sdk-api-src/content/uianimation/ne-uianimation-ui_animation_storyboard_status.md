## -remarks

Unless <a href="/windows/desktop/api/uianimation/nf-uianimation-iuianimationstoryboard-getstatus">IUIAnimationStoryboard::GetStatus</a> is called from a handler for <a href="/windows/desktop/api/uianimation/nf-uianimation-iuianimationstoryboardeventhandler-onstoryboardstatuschanged">OnStoryboardStatusChanged</a> events, it returns only the following status values:

<ul>
<li>UI_ANIMATION_STORYBOARD_BUILDING</li>
<li>UI_ANIMATION_STORYBOARD_SCHEDULED</li>
<li>UI_ANIMATION_STORYBOARD_PLAYING</li>
<li>UI_ANIMATION_STORYBOARD_READY</li>
</ul>
All status values can be passed to  <a href="/windows/desktop/api/uianimation/nf-uianimation-iuianimationstoryboardeventhandler-onstoryboardstatuschanged">IUIAnimationStoryboardEventHandler::OnStoryboardStatusChanged</a>.

The following diagram illustrates the transitions between these states.
