# IUIAnimationStoryboard::Conclude


## -description

Completes the current iteration of a keyframe loop that is in progress (where the loop is set to <b>UI_ANIMATION_REPEAT_INDEFINITELY</b>), terminates the loop, and continues with the storyboard.

## -parameters

## -returns

If the method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code. See <a href="/windows/desktop/UIAnimation/uianimation-error-codes">Windows Animation Error Codes</a> for a list of error codes.

## -remarks

This method specifies that any subsequent  keyframe loops that have a repetition count of <a href="/windows/desktop/UIAnimation/ui-animation-repeat-indefinitely">UI_ANIMATION_REPEAT_INDEFINITELY</a> (-1) will be skipped while the remainder of the storyboard is played.  

An iteration of a keyframe loop that is in progress will be completed before the remainder of the storyboard plays.

If this method is called  at the end  of a keyframe loop iteration, the loop is terminated and the loop value is set to the starting loop value.
