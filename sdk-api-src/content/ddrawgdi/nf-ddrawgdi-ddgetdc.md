# DdGetDC function


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[This function is subject to change with each operating system revision. Instead, use the DirectDraw and Microsoft Direct3DAPIs; these APIs insulate applications from such operating system changes, and hide many other difficulties involved in interacting directly with display drivers.]

Wrapper for the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/DevNotes/-dxgkernel-ntgdiddgetdc">NtGdiDdGetDC</a> function and returns a Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) 
   device context (DC) that represents the Microsoft DirectDraw surface indicated.


<b>GdiEntry7</b> is defined as an alias for this function.


## -parameters




### -param pSurfaceLocal

Pointer to the DirectDraw surface for which a DC is requested.


### -param pColorTable

Optional pointer to a 256-entry array of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dd162769(v=vs.85)">PALETTEENTRY</a> structures. If the color table is null, and the surface and display mode are both 8 bits per pixel, the DC shares the color table of the device.


## -returns



If successful, this function returns a valid <b>HDC</b>; otherwise it returns <b>NULL</b>.




## -remarks



If both the surface and the current display mode are palletized at 8 bits per pixel, the DC can be given the special property that its color table is shared by the color table of the display device. Applications are advised to call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ddraw/nf-ddraw-idirectdrawsurface7-getdc">IDirectDrawSurface7::GetDC</a> instead, which provides the same functionality in a manner independent of the operating system.


The returned DC must be freed by a call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/DevNotes/-dxgkernel-ntgdiddreleasedc">NtGdiDdReleaseDC</a> or <b>GdiEntry8</b>.
