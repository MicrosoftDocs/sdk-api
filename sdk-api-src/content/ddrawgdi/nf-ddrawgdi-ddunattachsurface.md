# DdUnattachSurface function


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[This function is subject to change with each operating system revision. Instead, use the Microsoft DirectDraw and Microsoft Direct3DAPIs; these APIs insulate applications from such operating system changes, and hide many other difficulties involved in interacting directly with display drivers.]

The <b>DdUnattachSurface</b> function removes an attachment, created with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ddrawgdi/nf-ddrawgdi-ddattachsurface">DdAttachSurface</a>, between two kernel-mode surface objects.

<b>GdiEntry12</b> is defined as an alias for this function.


## -parameters




### -param pSurface [in]

Pointer to the kernel-mode surface object that was passed as the <i>pSurfaceFrom</i> parameter to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ddrawgdi/nf-ddrawgdi-ddattachsurface">DdAttachSurface</a>.


### -param pSurfaceAttached [in]

Pointer to the kernel-mode surface object that was passed as the <i>pSurfaceTo</i> parameter to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ddrawgdi/nf-ddrawgdi-ddattachsurface">DdAttachSurface</a>



## -remarks



It is recommended that applications use the DirectDraw 
    API which handles surface attachments in a higher-level manner.

It is not necessary to call this function since the kernel will automatically destroy all attachments when <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/DevNotes/-dxgkernel-ntgdidddestroysurface">DdDestroySurface</a> is called.
