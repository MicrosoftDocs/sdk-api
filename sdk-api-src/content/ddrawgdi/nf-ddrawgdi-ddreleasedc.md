# DdReleaseDC function


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[This function is subject to change with each operating system revision. Instead, use the Microsoft DirectDraw and Microsoft Direct3DAPIs; these APIs insulate applications from such operating system changes, and hide many other difficulties involved in interacting directly with display drivers.]

Wrapper for the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/DevNotes/-dxgkernel-ntgdiddreleasedc">NtGdiDdReleaseDC</a> function and releases a device context (DC) previously obtained through <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ddrawgdi/nf-ddrawgdi-ddgetdc">DdGetDC</a> or <b>GdiEntry7</b>.


<b>GdiEntry8</b> is defined as an alias for this function.


## -parameters




### -param pSurfaceLocal

Pointer to the DirectDraw surface for which a DC was obtained.


## -returns



If successful, this function returns <b>TRUE</b>; otherwise it returns <b>FALSE</b>.




## -remarks



Applications that need to obtain a DC for a DirectDraw surface can  use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ddraw/nf-ddraw-idirectdrawsurface7-getdc">IDirectDrawSurface7::GetDC</a>, which exposes this functionality in a manner independent of the operating system.
