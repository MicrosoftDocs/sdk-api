# DML_MEAN_VARIANCE_NORMALIZATION_OPERATOR_DESC structure


## -description

Describes a DirectML operator that performs a mean variance normalization function on the input tensor.

Exponent = Const(2.0)

Epsilon = Const(1e-9)

X_RM = ReduceMean(X)

EX_squared = Pow(X_RM, Exponent)

X_squared = Pow(X, Exponent)

E_Xsquared = ReduceMean(X_squared)

Variance = Sub(E_Xsquared, EX_squared)

STD = Sqrt(Variance)

X_variance = Sub(X, X_RM)

Processed_STD = Add(STD, Epsilon)

X_MVN = Div(X_variance, Processed_STD)

## -struct-fields

### -field InputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to read from.

### -field ScaleTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

An optional pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the scale.

### -field BiasTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

An optional pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the bias.

### -field OutputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to write the results to.

### -field CrossChannel

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">BOOL</a></b>

<b>TRUE</b> if the LRN layer is channel-wise (cross-channel). Otherwise, <b>FALSE</b>.

### -field NormalizeVariance

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">BOOL</a></b>

<b>TRUE</b> if the variance should be normalized. Otherwise, <b>FALSE</b>.

### -field Epsilon

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">FLOAT</a></b>

The epsilon value to use to avoid division by zero.

### -field FusedActivation

Type: **const [DML_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_operator_desc)\***

An optional pointer to a constant [DML_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_operator_desc) containing the fused activation layer.
