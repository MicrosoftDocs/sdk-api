## -description

Describes a DirectML math operator that essentially performs a ternary `if` statement. It evaluates every element in <i>ConditionTensor</i>, and if `true` returns the corresponding element in <i>ATensor</i>, otherwise it returns the corresponding element in <i>BTensor</i>. Each input tensor can broadcast to the output shape.

```
For each condition, a, b in ConditionTensor, ATensor, BTensor
    if (b) then x else y

//  Example.
//  condition = bool [[1, 0], [1, 1]]
//  x = [[1, 2], [3, 4]] // first input
//  y = [[9, 8], [7, 6]] // second input
//  z = [[1, 8], [3, 4]] // output
```

Can be used to functionally build up other aggregate operators, such as LeakyRelu. Here's an illustration in pseudo-code (not the most efficiently, but possible): `LeakyRelu(X) = If(Less(X, 0), Mul(X, alpha), X)`).
