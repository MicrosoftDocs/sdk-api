# DML_ACTIVATION_IDENTITY_OPERATOR_DESC structure


## -description






Describes a DirectML activation operator that performs the identity function f(x) = x. The operator effectively copies its input tensor to the output.

This operator supports in-place execution, meaning the output tensor is permitted to alias the input tensor during binding.


## -struct-fields




### -field InputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to read from.


### -field OutputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to write the results to.
