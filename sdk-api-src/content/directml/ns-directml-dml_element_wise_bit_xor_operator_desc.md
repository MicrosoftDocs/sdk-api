## -description

Computes the bitwise XOR (eXclusive OR) between each corresponding element of the input tensors, and writes the result into the output tensor.

The bitwise operation is applied to tensor data in its native encoding. Therefore, the tensor data type is ignored except for determining the width of each element.

This operator supports in-place execution, meaning that the output tensor is permitted to alias one or more of the input tensors during binding.

## -struct-fields

### -field ATensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A tensor containing the left-hand side inputs.

### -field BTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A tensor containing the right-hand side inputs.

### -field OutputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The output tensor to write the results to.

## Example

```
InputTensor: (Sizes:{2,2}, DataType:UINT8)
[[0,  128], // 0b00000000, 0b10000000
 [42, 255]] // 0b00101010, 0b11111111

OutputTensor: (Sizes:{2,2}, DataType:UINT8)
[[255, 127], // 0b11111111, 0b01111111
 [213, 0  ]] // 0b11010101, 0b00000000
```

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_3_0`.

## Tensor constraints
*ATensor*, *BTensor*, and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DataType*, *DimensionCount*, and *Sizes*.
