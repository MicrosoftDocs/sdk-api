## -description

Describes a DirectML deep learning operator that performs a one-layer long short term memory (LSTM) function on the input. This operator uses multiple gates to perform this layer. These gates are performed multiple times in a loop, dictated by the sequence length dimension and the *SequenceLengthsTensor* argument.

### Equation for the forward direction

```
for (t = 0; t < seq_length; t++)
{
    $i_t = f(clip(X_t*W_i^T + H_{t-1} * R_i^T + P_i \bigodot C_{t-1} + W_{bi} + R_{bi}))$

    if (CoupleInputAndForget = 0)
        $f_t = f(clip(X_t*W_f^T + H_{t-1} * R_f^T + P_f \bigodot C_{t-1} + W_{bf} + R_{bf}))$
    else
        $f_t = 1.0 - i_t$

    $c_t = g(clip(X_t*W_c^T + H_{t-1} * R_c^T + W_{bc} + R_{bc}))$
    $C_t = f_t \bigodot C_{t-1} + i_t \bigodot c_t$
    $o_t = f(clip(X_t*W_o^T + H_{t-1} * R_o^T + P_o \bigodot C_{t-1} + W_{bo} + R_{bo}))$
    $H_t = o_t \bigodot h(ct)$ 
}
```

### Equation for the backward direction

```
for (t = seq_length - 1; t >= 0; t--)
{
    $i_t = f(clip(X_t*W_{Bi}^T + H_{t-1} * R_{Bi}^T + P_i \bigodot C_{t-1} + W_{Bbi} + R_{Bbi}))$

    if (CoupleInputAndForget = 0)
        $f_t = f(clip(X_t*W_{Bf}^T + H_{t-1} * R_{Bf}^T + P_f \bigodot C_{t-1} + W_{Bbf} + R_{Bbf}))$
    else
        $f_t = 1.0 - i_t$

    $c_t = g(clip(X_t*W_{Bc}^T + H_{t-1} * R_{Bc}^T + W_{Bbc} + R_{Bbc})$
    $C_t = f_t \bigodot C_{t-1} + i_t \bigodot c_t$
    $o_t = f(clip(X_t*W_{Bo}^T + H_{t-1} * R_{Bo}^T + P_o \bigodot C_{t-1} + W_{Bbo} + R_{Bbo}))$
    $H_t = o_t \bigodot h(ct)$ 
}
```

- $T$ signifies that a matrix will be transposed before use.
- $*$ signifies a matrix multiplication.
- $+$ signifies an element-wise addition of two matrices.
- $\bigodot$ signifies an element-wise multiply of two matrices.
- $f(),g(),h()$ activation functions dictated by *ActivationDescs*.
- clip() optional clipping operation, which is controlled by *UseClipThreshold*.

- $W_{[iofc]}^T$ Forward sub-matrix defined in *WeightTensor*, which is defined to be size [1, batch_size, input_size]. This matrix will be transposed before use.

This is defined to be size [1, batch_size, hidden_size]. A different *CellMemoryInitTensor* sub-matrix is used for each direction.
- $W_{b[iofc]}$, $R_{b[iofc]}$ are the bias tensors for the weight tensor, and recurrence tensor, which are sub-matrices of *BiasTensor*. These matrices are size [1,hidden_size], and are broadcasted up to the required size, which is [1, batch_size, hidden_size].
- $W_{Bb[iofc]}$, $R_{Bb[iofc]}$ are the bias tensors for the backwards direction.
- $i_t$ stands for input gate at index $t$.
- $o_t$ stands for output gate at index $t$.
