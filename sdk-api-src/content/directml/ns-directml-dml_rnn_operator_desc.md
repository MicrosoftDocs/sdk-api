## -description

Describes a DirectML deep learning operator that performs a one-layer simple recurrent neural network (RNN) function on the input. This function is often referred to as the *Input Gate*. This operator performs this function multiple times in a loop, dictated by the sequence length dimension and the *SequenceLengthsTensor* argument.

### Equation for the forward direction

```
for (t = 0; t < seq_length; t++)
{
    $H_t = f(X_t*W_i^T + H_{t-1} * R_i^T + W_{bi} + R_{bi})$
}
```

### Equation for the backward direction

```
for (t = seq_length - 1; t >= 0; t--)
{
    $H_t = f(X_t*W_{Bi}^T + H_{t-1} * R_{Bi}^T + W_{Bbi} + R_{Bbi})$
}
```

### Equation legend
- $t$ current RNN layer index.
- $t-1$ previous RNN layer index. If backwards direction, then it means $t+1$ index but still the previously calculated $t$.
- $T$ signifies that a matrix will be transposed before use.
- $*$ signifies a matrix multiplication.
- $+$ signifies a element-wise addition of two matrices.
- $H_t$ output of current RNN index $t$.
- $f()$ activation function dictated by *ActivationDescs*.
- $X_t$ Sub-matrix of the *InputTensor*, which is defined by matrix index [$t$, batch_size, input_size].
- $W_i^T$ Forward sub-matrix defined in *WeightTensor*, which is defined to be size [1, batch_size, input_size]. This matrix will be transposed before use.
- $W_{Bi}^T$ Backwards sub-matrix defined in *WeightTensor*, which is defined to be size [1, batch_size, input_size]. This matrix will be transposed before use.
- $H_{t-1}$ an intermediate tensor that's defined to be the output of the previous layer. For $t = 0$, H_{t-1} is replaced with *HiddenInitTensor*. This is defined to be size [1, batch_size, hidden_size]. A different *HiddenInitTensor* sub-matrix is used for each direction.
- $R_i^T$ Forward sub-matrix of *RecurrenceTensor*, which is defined to be size [1, hidden_size, hidden_size]. This matrix will be transposed before use.
- $R_{Bi}^T$ Backwards sub-matrix of *RecurrenceTensor*, which is defined to be size [1, hidden_size, hidden_size]. This matrix will be transposed before use.
- $W_{bi}$, $R_{bi}$ are the bias tensors of the weight tensor, and recurrence tensor, which are one of the sub-matrices of *BiasTensor*. This matrix is size [1,hidden_size] and is broadcasted up to the required size which is [1, batch_size, hidden_size].
- $W_{Bbi}$, $R_{Bbi}$ are the bias tensors for the backwards direction
- $i$ stands for input gate.
