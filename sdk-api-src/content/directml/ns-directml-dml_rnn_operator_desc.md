## -description

Performs a one-layer simple recurrent neural network (RNN) function on the input. This function is often referred to as the Input Gate. This operator performs this function multiple times in a loop, dictated by the sequence length dimension and the *SequenceLengthsTensor*.

## -struct-fields

### -field InputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A tensor containing the input data, X. Packed (and potentially padded) into one 4-D tensor with the sizes of `{ 1, seq_length, batch_size, input_size }`. seq_length is the dimension that is mapped to the index, t.

### -field WeightTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A tensor containing the weight data, W. Concatenation of W_i and W_Bi (if bidirectional). The tensor has sizes `{ 1, num_directions, hidden_size, input_size }`.

### -field RecurrenceTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

An optional tensor containing the recurrence weight data, R. Concatenation of R_i and R_Bi (if bidirectional). This tensor has sizes `{ 1, num_directions, hidden_size, hidden_size }`.

### -field BiasTensor

Type: \_Maybenull\_ **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

An optional tensor containing the bias data for the input gate, B. Concatenation of `{ W_bi, R_bi }`, and `{ W_Bbi, R_Bbi }` (if bidirectional). This tensor has sizes `{ 1, 1, num_directions, 2 * hidden_size }`. If not specified, then defaults to 0.

### -field HiddenInitTensor

Type: \_Maybenull\_ **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

An optional tensor containing the hidden node initializer tensor, H_[t-1] for the first loop index t. If not specified, then defaults to 0. This tensor has sizes `{ 1, num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size }`.

### -field SequenceLengthsTensor

Type: \_Maybenull\_ **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

An optional tensor containing an independent seq_length for each element in the batch. If not specified, then all sequences in the batch have length seq_length. This tensor has sizes `{ 1, 1, 1, batch_size }`.

### -field OutputSequenceTensor

Type: \_Maybenull\_ **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

An optional tensor with which to write the concatenation of all the intermediate layer output values of the hidden nodes, H_t. This tensor has sizes `{ seq_length, num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size }`. seq_length is mapped to the loop index t.

### -field OutputSingleTensor

Type: \_Maybenull\_ **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

An optional tensor with which to write the final output value of the hidden nodes, H_t. This tensor has sizes `{ 1, num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size }`.

### -field ActivationDescCount

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

This field determines the size of the *ActivationDescs* array.

### -field ActivationDescs

Type: \_Field\_size\_(ActivationDescCount) **const [DML_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_operator_desc)\***

An array of [DML_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_operator_desc) containing the descriptions of the activation operators, f(). The number of activation functions is equal to the number of directions. For forwards and backwards directions there is expected to be 1 activation fuction. For Bidirectional there are expected to be 2.

### -field Direction

Type: **[DML_RECURRENT_NETWORK_DIRECTION](/windows/win32/api/directml/ne-directml-dml_recurrent_network_direction)**

The direction of the operator: forward, backward, or bidirectional.

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_1_0`.

## Tensor constraints
*BiasTensor*, `HiddenInitTensor`, *InputTensor*, `OutputSequenceTensor`, `OutputSingleTensor`, `RecurrenceTensor`, and `WeightTensor` must have the same *DataType*.
