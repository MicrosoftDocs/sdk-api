## -description






Describes a DirectML data reorganization operator that performs the cast function f(x) = cast(x), casting each element in the input to  the data type of the output tensor, and storing the result in the corresponding element in the output.


## -struct-fields




### -field InputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***
