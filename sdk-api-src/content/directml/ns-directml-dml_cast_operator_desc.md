## -description

Casts each element in the input to the data type of the output tensor, and stores the result in the corresponding element of the output.

## -struct-fields

### -field InputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The tensor to write the results to. This tensor's *Sizes* should match *InputTensor*.

### -field OutputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to write the results to.

## -remarks

Some data types might not be supported on certain hardware. To determine whether a data type is supported, use [IDMLDevice::CheckFeatureSupport](/windows/win32/api/directml/nf-directml-idmldevice-checkfeaturesupport) with [DML_FEATURE_TENSOR_DATA_TYPE_SUPPORT](/windows/win32/api/directml/ne-directml-dml_feature).

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_1_0`.

## Tensor constraints

*InputTensor* and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DimensionCount* and *Sizes*.
