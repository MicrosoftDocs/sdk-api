# DML_DEPTH_TO_SPACE_OPERATOR_DESC structure


## -description






Describes a DirectML data reorganization operator that rearranges (permutes) data from depth into blocks of spatial data. The operator outputs a copy of the input tensor where values from the depth dimension are moved in spatial blocks to the height and width dimensions.

This is the reverse transformation of [DML_SPACE_TO_DEPTH_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_space_to_depth_operator_desc).


## -struct-fields




### -field InputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to read from. The input tensor's dimensions are [N,C,H,W], where N is the batch axis, C is the channel or depth, H is the height, and W is the width.


### -field OutputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to write the results to. The output tensor's dimensions are [N, C / (<i>BlockSize</i> * <i>BlockSize</i>), H * <i>BlockSize</i>, W * <i>BlockSize</i>].


### -field BlockSize

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

Blocks of [<i>BlockSize</i>, <i>BlockSize</i>] are moved.
