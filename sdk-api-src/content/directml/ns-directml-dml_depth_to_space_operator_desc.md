## -description

Rearranges (permutes) data from depth into blocks of spatial data. The operator outputs a copy of the input tensor where values from the depth dimension are moved in spatial blocks to the height and width dimensions.

This is the inverse transformation of [DML_SPACE_TO_DEPTH_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_space_to_depth_operator_desc).

## -struct-fields

### -field InputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The tensor to read from. The input tensor's dimensions are `{ BatchCount, InputChannelCount, InputHeight, InputWidth }`.

### -field OutputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The tensor to write the results to. The output tensor's dimensions are `{ BatchCount, OutputChannelCount, OutputHeight, OutputWidth }`, where:

* OutputChannelCount is computed as InputChannelCount / (*BlockSize* * *BlockSize*).
* OutputHeight is computed as InputHeight * *BlockSize*.
* OutputWidth is computed as InputWidth * *BlockSize*.

### -field BlockSize

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

The width and height of the blocks that are moved.

## Example

```
BlockSize: 2
InputTensor: (Sizes:{1, 8, 2, 3}, DataType:UINT32)
[[[[0,   1,  2],
   [3,   4,  5]],
  [[9,  10, 11],
   [12, 13, 14]],
  [[18, 19, 20],
   [21, 22, 23]],
  [[27, 28, 29],
   [30, 31, 32]],
  [[36, 37, 38],
   [39, 40, 41]],
  [[45, 46, 47],
   [48, 49, 50]],
  [[54, 55, 56],
   [57, 58, 59]],
  [[63, 64, 65],
   [66, 67, 68]]]]

OutputTensor: (Sizes:{1, 2, 4, 6}, DataType:UINT32)
 [[[[ 0, 18,  1, 19,  2, 20],
    [36, 54, 37, 55, 38, 56],
    [ 3, 21,  4, 22,  5, 23],
    [39, 57, 40, 58, 41, 59]],
   [[ 9, 27, 10, 28, 11, 29],
    [45, 63, 46, 64, 47, 65],
    [12, 30, 13, 31, 14, 32],
    [48, 66, 49, 67, 50, 68]]]]
```

## -remarks
A newer version of this operator, [DML_DEPTH_TO_SPACE1_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_depth_to_space1_operator_desc), was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_2_1`.

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_1_0`.

## Tensor constraints
*InputTensor* and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DataType*.
