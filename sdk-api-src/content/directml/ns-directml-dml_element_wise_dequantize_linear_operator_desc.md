## -description

Performs the following linear dequantization function on every element in *InputTensor* with respect to its corresponding element in *ScaleTensor* and `ZeroPointTensor`, placing the results in the corresponding element of *OutputTensor*.

```
f(input, scale, zero_point) = (input - zero_point) * scale
```

Quantization is a common way to increase performance at the cost of precision. A group of 8-bit int values can be computed faster than a group of 32-bit float values can. Dequantizing converts the encoded data back to its domain.

## -struct-fields

### -field InputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The tensor containing the inputs.

### -field ScaleTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The tensor containing the scales.

### -field ZeroPointTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The tensor containing the zero point that was used for quantization.

### -field OutputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The output tensor to write the results to.

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_1_0`.

## Tensor constraints
* *InputTensor* and `ZeroPointTensor` must have the same *DataType*.
* *InputTensor*, *OutputTensor*, *ScaleTensor*, and `ZeroPointTensor` must have the same *DimensionCount* and *Sizes*.
