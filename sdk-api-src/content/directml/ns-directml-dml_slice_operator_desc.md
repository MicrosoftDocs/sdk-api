# DML_SLICE_OPERATOR_DESC structure


## -description

Describes a DirectML data reorganization operator that extracts a single subregion (a "slice") of an input tensor.

This operator copies elements from the input tensor in each dimension N starting from the Offset[N], and advancing Strides[N] elements on the input tensor until Sizes[N] elements are copied to the output tensor.

For example a slice with Offsets [0 0 0 10], Sizes [1 1 1 5], and Strides [1 1 1 2] will copy every second element starting at the 10th element of the input tensor, until a total of 5 elements are copied to the output tensor.

## -struct-fields

### -field InputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to extract slices from.

### -field OutputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to write the sliced data results to.

### -field DimensionCount

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

The number of dimensions. This field determines the size of the <i>Offsets</i>,  <i>Sizes</i>, and <i>Strides</i> arrays. This value must match the DimensionCount of the input and output tensors.

### -field Offsets

Type: <b>const [UINT](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)*</b>

A pointer to a constant array of [UINT](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types) containing the starting index of each dimension to slice from the input tensor.

### -field Sizes

Type: <b>const [UINT](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)*</b>

A pointer to a constant array of [UINT](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types) containing the size of each dimension of the slice, in elements. The values in this array must match the sizes specified in the output tensor.

### -field Strides

Type: <b>const [UINT](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)*</b>

A pointer to a constant array of [UINT](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types) containing the element strides for each dimension in the slice.
