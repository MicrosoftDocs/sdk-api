# DML_ELEMENT_WISE_THRESHOLD_OPERATOR_DESC structure


## -description

Describes a DirectML math operator that performs the element-wise threshold function f(x) = max(x * scale + bias, min), where the scale and bias terms are optional. The threshold of x with respect to min is the larger of the two values.

This operator supports in-place execution, meaning the output tensor is permitted to alias the input tensor during binding.

## -struct-fields

### -field InputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to read from.

### -field OutputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to write the results to.

### -field ScaleBias

Type: **const [DML_SCALE_BIAS](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_scale_bias)\***

An optional pointer to a constant [DML_SCALE_BIAS](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_scale_bias) containing scale and bias to apply to the input. If present, this has the effect of applying the function g(x) = x * scale + bias to each element before this topic's operator is applied.

### -field Min

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">FLOAT</a></b>

The minimum value, below which the operator replaces the value with <i>Min</i>.
