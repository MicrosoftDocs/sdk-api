## -description

Performs a softmax activation function on *InputTensor*, placing the result into the corresponding element of *OutputTensor*.

```
// Let x_i be the current value in the axis, and j be the total number of elements along that axis.
f(x_i) = exp(x_i) / sum(exp(x_0), ..., exp(x_j))
```

Where exp(x) is the natural exponentiation function.

## -struct-fields

### -field InputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The input tensor to read from. This tensor must have an *effective rank* no greater than 2. The effective rank of a tensor is the *DimensionCount* of the tensor, excluding leftmost dimensions of size 1. For example a tensor size of `{ 1, 1, BatchCount, Width }` is valid, and is equivalent to a tensor of sizes `{ BatchCount, Width }`.

### -field OutputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The output tensor to write the results to.

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_1_0`.

## Tensor constraints
*InputTensor* and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DataType*, *DimensionCount*, and *Sizes*.
