## -description

Generates an identity-like matrix with ones (or other explicit value) on the major diagonal, and zeros everywhere else. The diagonal ones may be shifted (via *Offset*) where `OutputTensor[i, i + Offset]` = *Value*, meaning that an argument of *Offset* greater than zero shifts all values to the right, and less than zero shifts them to the left. This generator operator is useful for models to avoid storing a large constant tensor. Any leading dimensions before the last two are treated as a batch count, meaning that the tensor is treated as stack of 2D matrices.

This operator performs the following pseudocode.

```
for each coordinate in OutputTensor
    OutputTensor[coordinate] = if (coordinate.y + Offset == coordinate.x) then Value else 0
endfor
```

## -struct-fields

### -field OutputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The tensor to write the results to. The dimensions are `{ Batch1, Batch2, OutputHeight, OutputWidth }`. The height and width don't need to be square.

### -field Offset

Type: **[INT](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)**

An offset to shift the diagonal lines of *Value*, with positive offsets shifting the written value to the right/up (viewing the output as a matrix with the top left as 0,0), and negative offsets to the left/down.

### -field Value

Type: **[FLOAT](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)**

A value to fill along the 2D diagonal. The standard value is 1.0. Note that if the *DataType* of the tensors is not [DML_TENSOR_DATA_TYPE_FLOAT16](/windows/win32/api/directml/ne-directml-dml_tensor_data_type) or **DML_TENSOR_DATA_TYPE_FLOAT32**, then the value might be truncated (for example, 10.6 will become 10).

## Examples

Default identity matrix:

```
Offset: 0
Value: 1.0
OutputTensor: (Sizes:{1,1,3,3}, DataType:FLOAT32)
    [[[[1, 0, 0],
       [0, 1, 0],
       [0, 0, 1]]]]
```

Shift ones right/up:

```
Offset: 1
Value: 1.0
OutputTensor: (Sizes:{1,1,3,3}, DataType:FLOAT32)
    [[[[ 0, 1, 0],
       [ 0, 0, 1],
       [ 0, 0, 0]]]]
```

Shift ones left/down:

```
Offset: -1
Value: 1.0
OutputTensor: (Sizes:{1,1,3,2}, DataType:FLOAT32)
    [[[[0, 0],
       [1, 0],
       [0, 1]]]]
```

Shift the diagonal line of ones so far that all become zeroes:

```
Offset: -3
Value: 1.0
OutputTensor: (Sizes:{1,1,3,2}, DataType:FLOAT32)
    [[[[0, 0],
       [0, 0],
       [0, 0]]]]
```
