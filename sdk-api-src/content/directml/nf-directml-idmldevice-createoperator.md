# IDMLDevice::CreateOperator


## -description






Creates a DirectML operator.

In DirectML, an operator represents an abstract bundle of functionality, which can be compiled into a form suitable
        for execution on the GPU. Operator objects cannot be executed directly; they must first be compiled into an
        [IDMLCompiledOperator](/windows/desktop/api/directml/nn-directml-idmlcompiledoperator).


## -parameters




### -param desc

Type: **const [DML_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_operator_desc)\***

The description of the operator to be created.


### -param riid

Type: <b>REFIID</b>

A reference to the globally unique identifier (GUID) of the interface that you wish to be returned in <i>ppv</i>. This is expected to be the GUID of [IDMLOperator](/windows/desktop/api/directml/nn-directml-idmloperator).


### -param ppv [out]

Type: <b>void**</b>

A pointer to a memory block that receives a pointer to the operator. This is the address of a pointer to an [IDMLOperator](/windows/desktop/api/directml/nn-directml-idmloperator), representing  the operator created.


## -returns



Type: [**HRESULT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

If this method succeeds, it returns **S_OK**. Otherwise, it returns an **HRESULT** error code.
