# DML_SPLIT_OPERATOR_DESC structure


## -description






Describes a DirectML data reorganization operator that splits the input tensor into multiple output tensors, along the specified axis.


## -struct-fields




### -field InputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to read from.


### -field OutputCount

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

This field determines the size of the <i>OutputTensors</i> array.


### -field OutputTensors

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant array of [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the descriptions of the tensors to write the results to.


### -field Axis

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

The axis to split on.
