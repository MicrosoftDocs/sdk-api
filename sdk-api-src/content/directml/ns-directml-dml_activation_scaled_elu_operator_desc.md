# DML_ACTIVATION_SCALED_ELU_OPERATOR_DESC structure


## -description

Describes a DirectML operator that performs a scaled exponential linear unit (ELU) activation function on every element in the input, f(x) = if x &gt; 0 then gamma * x else gamma * (alpha * e^x - alpha).

This operator supports in-place execution, meaning the output tensor is permitted to alias the input tensor during binding.

## -struct-fields

### -field InputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to read from.

### -field OutputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to write the results to.

### -field Alpha

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">FLOAT</a></b>

The value of alpha. You can use a default value of 1.6732.

### -field Gamma

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">FLOAT</a></b>

The value of gamma. You can use a default value of 1.0507.
