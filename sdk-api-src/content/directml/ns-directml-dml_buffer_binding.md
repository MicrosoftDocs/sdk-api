# DML_BUFFER_BINDING structure


## -description

Specifies a resource binding described by a range of bytes in a Direct3D 12 buffer, represented by an offset and size into an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nn-d3d12-id3d12resource">ID3D12Resource</a>.

## -struct-fields

### -field Buffer

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nn-d3d12-id3d12resource">ID3D12Resource</a>*</b>

An optional pointer to an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nn-d3d12-id3d12resource">ID3D12Resource</a> interface representing a buffer. The resource must have dimension <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ne-d3d12-d3d12_resource_dimension">D3D12_RESOURCE_DIMENSION_BUFFER</a>, and the
      range described by this struct must lie within the bounds of the buffer. You may supply <b>nullptr</b> for this member to indicate 'no binding'.

### -field Offset

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT64</a></b>

The offset, in bytes, from the start of the buffer where the range begins. This offset must be aligned to a
      multiple of [DML_MINIMUM_BUFFER_TENSOR_ALIGNMENT](/windows/desktop/direct3d12/direct3d-directml-constants) or the <b>GuaranteedBaseOffsetAlignment</b> supplied as part of the
      [DML_BUFFER_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_buffer_tensor_desc).

### -field SizeInBytes

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT64</a></b>

The size of the range, in bytes.
