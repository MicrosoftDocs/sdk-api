# DML_ACTIVATION_RELU_OPERATOR_DESC structure


## -description

Describes a DirectML operator that performs a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function on every element in the input, f(x) = max(0, x).

This operator supports in-place execution, meaning the output tensor is permitted to alias the input tensor during binding.

## -struct-fields

### -field InputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to read from. This operator supports in-place execution. That is, the supplied output tensor may be the same as the supplied input tensor.

### -field OutputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to write the results to.
