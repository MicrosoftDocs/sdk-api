# DML_ACTIVATION_HARD_SIGMOID_OPERATOR_DESC structure


## -description

Describes a DirectML activation operator that performs a hard sigmoid function on every element in the input, f(x) = max(0, min(alpha * x + beta, 1)).

This operator supports in-place execution, meaning the output tensor is permitted to alias the input tensor during binding.

## -struct-fields

### -field InputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to read from.

### -field OutputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to write the results to.
