# DML_PADDING_OPERATOR_DESC structure


## -description

Describes a DirectML data reorganization operator that inflates the input tensor with zeroes (or some other value) on the edges.

## -struct-fields

### -field InputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to read from.

### -field OutputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to write the results to.

### -field PaddingMode

Type: [**DML_PADDING_MODE**](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ne-directml-dml_padding_mode)

The padding mode to use.

### -field PaddingValue

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">FLOAT</a></b>

The value with which to pad.

### -field DimensionCount

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

The number of dimensions. This field determines the size of the <i>StartPadding</i> and <i>EndPadding</i> arrays.

### -field StartPadding

Type: <b>const [UINT](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)*</b>

A pointer to a constant array of [UINT](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types) containing the padding (number of pixels added) to the start of the corresponding axis. Padding defaults to 0 along the start and end of each axis.

### -field EndPadding

Type: <b>const [UINT](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)*</b>

A pointer to a constant array of [UINT](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types) containing the padding (number of pixels added) to the end of the corresponding axis. Padding defaults to 0 along the start and end of each axis.
