## -description

Gets information about the optional features and capabilities that are supported by the DirectML device.

## -parameters

### -param feature

Type: [**DML_FEATURE**](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ne-directml-dml_feature)

A constant from the [DML_FEATURE](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ne-directml-dml_feature) enumeration describing the feature(s) that you want to query for support.

### -param featureQueryDataSize

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

The size of the structure pointed to by the <i>featureQueryData</i> parameter, if provided, otherwise 0.

### -param featureQueryData [in, optional]

Type: <b>const void*</b>

An optional pointer to a query structure that corresponds to the value of the <i>feature</i> parameter. To determine the corresponding query type for each constant, see [DML_FEATURE](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ne-directml-dml_feature).

### -param featureSupportDataSize

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

The size of the structure pointed to by the <i>featureSupportData</i> parameter.

### -param featureSupportData [out]

Type: <b>void*</b>

A pointer to a support data structure that corresponds to the value of the <i>feature</i> parameter. To determine the corresponding support data type for each constant, see [DML_FEATURE](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ne-directml-dml_feature).

## -returns

Type: [**HRESULT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

If this method succeeds, it returns **S_OK**. Otherwise, it returns **DXGI_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED** if the [DML_FEATURE](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ne-directml-dml_feature) is unrecognized or unsupported, and **E_INVALIDARG** if the parameters are incorrect.
