# DML_BINDING_PROPERTIES structure


## -description






Contains information about the binding requirements of a particular compiled operator, or operator initializer. This struct is retrieved from [IDMLDispatchable::GetBindingProperties](/windows/desktop/api/directml/nf-directml-idmldispatchable-getbindingproperties).


## -struct-fields




### -field RequiredDescriptorCount

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

The minimum size, in descriptors, of the binding table required for a particular dispatchable object (an operator initializer, or a compiled operator).


### -field TemporaryResourceSize

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT64</a></b>

The minimum size in bytes of the temporary resource that must be bound to the binding table for a particular dispatchable
      object. A value of zero means that a temporary resource is not required.


### -field PersistentResourceSize

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT64</a></b>

The minimum size in bytes of the persistent resource that must be bound to the binding table for a particular
      dispatchable object. Persistent resources must be supplied during initialization of a compiled operator (where it
      is bound as an output of the operator initializer) as well as during execution. A value of zero means that a
      persistent resource is not required. Only compiled operators have persistent resources—operator initializers
      always return a value of 0 for this member.
