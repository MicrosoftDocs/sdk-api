# DML_ROI_POOLING_OPERATOR_DESC structure


## -description






Describes a DirectML operator that performs a pooling function across the input tensor (according to regions of interest, or ROIs).


## -struct-fields




### -field InputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to read from. This tensor's dimensions are [N, C, H, W], where N is the batch size, C is the number of channels, and H and W are the height and the width of the data.


### -field ROITensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the regions of interest (ROIs) to pool over. This tensor is a 2-D tensor of shape (num_rois, 5) given as [[batch_id, x1, y1, x2, y2], ...].


### -field OutputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to write the results to. This tensor is the ROI-pooled output; a 4-D tensor of shape (num_rois, channels, pooled_size[0], pooled_size[1]).


### -field SpatialScale

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">FLOAT</a></b>

Multiplicative spatial scale factor, used to translate the ROI coordinates from their input scale to the scale used when pooling. You can use a default value of 1.0.


### -field PooledSize

Type: [**DML_SIZE_2D**](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_size_2d)

The ROI pool output size (height, width).
