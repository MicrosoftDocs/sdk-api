## -description

Takes the greater of two corresponding elements from the input tensors, and places the result into the corresponding element of the output tensor.

```
f(a, b) = max(a, b)
```

This operator supports in-place execution, meaning that *OutputTensor* is permitted to alias one of the the input tensors during binding.

## -struct-fields

### -field ATensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A tensor containing the left-hand side inputs.

### -field BTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A tensor containing the right-hand side inputs.

### -field OutputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The output tensor to write the results to.


## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_1_0`.

## Tensor constraints
*ATensor*, *BTensor*, and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DataType*, *DimensionCount*, and *Sizes*.
