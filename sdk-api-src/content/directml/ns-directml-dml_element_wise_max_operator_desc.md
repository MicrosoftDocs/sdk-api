# DML_ELEMENT_WISE_MAX_OPERATOR_DESC structure


## -description






Describes a DirectML math reduction operator that performs a maximum function between every element in <i>ATensor</i> and its corresponding element in <i>BTensor</i>, f(a, b) = max(a, b).

This operator supports in-place execution, meaning the output tensor is permitted to alias one of the input tensors during binding.


## -struct-fields




### -field ATensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the <i>A</i> tensor to read from.


### -field BTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the <i>B</i> tensor to read from.


### -field OutputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to write the results to.
