# DML_TILE_OPERATOR_DESC structure


## -description






Describes a DirectML data reorganization operator that constructs  an output tensor by tiling the input tensor.

For example, InputTensor = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], Repeats = [1, 2], gives OutputTensor = [[1, 2, 1, 2], [3, 4, 3, 4]].


## -struct-fields




### -field InputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to read from; this can be of any shape.


### -field OutputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A pointer to a constant [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/desktop/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc) containing the description of the tensor to write the results to. This tensor is of the same dimension and type as the input tensor. Output_dim[i] = input_dim[i] * repeats[i].


### -field RepeatsCount

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

This field determines the size of the <i>Repeats</i> array.


### -field Repeats

Type: <b>const [UINT](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)*</b>

Each value in this array corresponds to one of the input tensor's dimensions (in order). Each value is the number of tiled copies to make of that dimension.
