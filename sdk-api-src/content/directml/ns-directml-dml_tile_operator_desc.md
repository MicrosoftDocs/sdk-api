## -description

Constructs an output tensor by tiling the input tensor. The elements in each dimension of the input tensor are repeated by a multiple in the *Repeats* array.

## -struct-fields

### -field InputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The tensor to read from, which contains the elements to be tiled.

### -field OutputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The tensor to write to, which will hold the tiled output. For each dimension `i` in `[0, InputTensor.DimensionCount-1]`, the output size is calculated as `OutputTensor.Sizes[i] = InputTensor.Sizes[i] * Repeats[i]`. This tensor must have the same *DimensionCount* as the input tensor.

### -field RepeatsCount

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

This field determines the size of the *Repeats* array. This value must be the same as the *InputTensor.DimensionCount*.

### -field Repeats

Type: <b>const [UINT](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)*</b>

Each value in this array corresponds to one of the input tensor's dimensions (in order). Each value is the number of tiled copies to make of that dimension. Values must be larger than 0.

## Examples

```
RepeatsCount: 4
Repeats: {1, 1, 3, 3}

InputTensor: (Sizes:{1, 1, 2, 3}, DataType:FLOAT32)
[[[[1, 2, 3]
   [4, 5, 6]]]]

InputTensor: (Sizes:{1, 1, 6, 9}, DataType:FLOAT32)
[[[[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
   [4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6] 
   [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3] 
   [4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6] 
   [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3] 
   [4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6]]]]
```

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_1_0`.

## Tensor constraints
*InputTensor* and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DataType*.
