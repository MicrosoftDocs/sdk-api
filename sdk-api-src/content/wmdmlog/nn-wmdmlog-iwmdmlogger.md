# IWMDMLogger interface


## -description

The <b>IWMDMLogger</b> interface is used by Windows Media Device Manager applications and service providers to log entries in a common log file. Components do not need to be certified to use this object.

This interface is exposed by a COM object that must be created using the class ID CLSID_WMDMLogger, as shown here:


```cpp

IWMDMLogger* m_pLogger = NULL;
CoCreateInstance(CLSID_WMDMLogger, NULL, CLSCTX_ALL, __uuidof(IWMDMLogger), (void**)&m_pLogger);

```


This interface GUID is not properly defined in mssachlp.lib; therefore, to get the proper definitions when implementing this interface, you must #include both mswmdm.h and wmdmlog_i.c from wmdmlog.idl.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IWMDMLogger</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IWMDMLogger</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>
