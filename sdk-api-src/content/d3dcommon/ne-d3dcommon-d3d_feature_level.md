# D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL enumeration


## -description

Describes the set of features targeted by a Direct3D device.

## -enum-fields

### -field D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_1_0_CORE (0x1000)

Allows Microsoft Compute Driver Model (MCDM) devices to be used, or more feature-rich devices (such as traditional GPUs) that support a superset of the functionality. MCDM is the overall driver model for compute-only; it's a scaled-down peer of the larger scoped Windows Device Driver Model (WDDM).

### -field D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_9_1 (0x9100)

Targets features supported by [feature level](/windows/desktop/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-devices-downlevel-intro) 9.1, including shader model 2.

### -field D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_9_2 (0x9200)

Targets features supported by [feature level](/windows/desktop/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-devices-downlevel-intro) 9.2, including shader model 2.

### -field D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_9_3 (0x9300)

Targets features supported by [feature level](/windows/desktop/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-devices-downlevel-intro) 9.3, including shader model 2.0b.

### -field D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_10_0 (0xa000)

Targets features supported by Direct3D 10.0, including shader model 4.

### -field D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_10_1 (0xa100)

Targets features supported by Direct3D 10.1, including shader model 4.

### -field D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_11_0 (0xb000)

Targets features supported by Direct3D 11.0, including shader model 5.

### -field D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_11_1 (0xb100)

Targets features supported by Direct3D 11.1, including shader model 5 and logical blend operations. This feature level requires a display driver that is at least implemented to WDDM for WindowsÂ 8 (WDDM 1.2).

### -field D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_12_0 (0xc000)

Targets features supported by Direct3D 12.0, including shader model 5.

### -field D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_12_1 (0xc100)

Targets features supported by Direct3D 12.1, including shader model 5.

## -remarks

For an overview of the capabilities of each feature level, see [Direct3D feature levels](/windows/desktop/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-devices-downlevel-intro).

For information about limitations creating non-hardware-type devices on certain feature levels, see [Limitations creating WARP and reference devices](/windows/desktop/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-devices-limitations).
