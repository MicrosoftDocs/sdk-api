<b>ID3DInclude</b> is an include interface that the user implements to allow an application to call user-overridable methods for opening and closing shader #include files.
      


## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">ID3DInclude</b> interface inherits from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>ID3DInclude</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>
