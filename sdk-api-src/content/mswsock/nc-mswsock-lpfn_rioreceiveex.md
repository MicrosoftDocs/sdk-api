## -description

The **RIOReceiveEx** function receives network data on a connected registered I/O TCP socket or a bound registered I/O UDP socket with additional options for use with the Winsock registered I/O extensions.

## -parameters

### -param SocketQueue

A descriptor that identifies a connected registered I/O UDP socket or a bound registered I/O UDP socket.

### -param pData

A description of the portion of the registered buffer in which to receive data.

This parameter may be NULL for a bound registered I/O UDP socket if the application does not need to receive a data payload in the UDP datagram.

### -param DataBufferCount

A data buffer count parameter that indicates if data is to be received in the buffer pointed to by the *pData* parameter.

This parameter should be set to zero if the *pData* is NULL. Otherwise, this parameter should be set to 1.

### -param pLocalAddress

A buffer segment that on completion will hold the local address on which the network data was received.

This parameter may be **NULL** if the application does not want to receive the local address. If this parameter is not **NULL**, then the buffer segment must be at least the size of a [**SOCKADDR\_INET**](../ws2ipdef/ns-ws2ipdef-sockaddr_inet.md) structure.

### -param pRemoteAddress

A buffer segment that on completion will hold the remote address from which the network data was received.

This parameter may be **NULL** if the application does not want to receive the remote address. If this parameter is not **NULL**, then the buffer segment must be at least the size of a [**SOCKADDR\_INET**](../ws2ipdef/ns-ws2ipdef-sockaddr_inet.md) structure.

### -param pControlContext

A buffer slice that on completion will hold additional control information about the receive operation.

This parameter may be **NULL** if the application does not want to receive the additional control information.

### -param pFlags\\A buffer slice that on completion will hold additional information about the set of flags for the receive operation.

This parameter may be **NULL** if the application does not want to receive the additional flags information.

### -param Flags

A set of flags that modify the behavior of the **RIOReceiveEx** function.

The *Flags* parameter can contain a combination of the following options defined in the *Mswsockdef.h* header file:

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 50%" /><col style="width: 50%" /></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th>Flag</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><span id="RIO_MSG_COMMIT_ONLY"></span><span id="rio_msg_commit_only"></span><dl> <dt><strong>RIO_MSG_COMMIT_ONLY</strong></dt> </dl></td><td>Previous requests added with <strong>RIO_MSG_DEFER</strong> flag will be committed. <br/> When the <strong>RIO_MSG_COMMIT_ONLY</strong> flag is set, no other flags may be specified. When the <strong>RIO_MSG_COMMIT_ONLY</strong> flag is set, the <em>pData</em>, <em>pLocalAddress</em>, <em>pRemoteAddress</em>, <em>pControlContext</em>, <em>pFlags</em>, and <em>RequestContext</em> parameters must be NULL and the <em>DataBufferCount</em> parameter must be zero. <br/> This flag would normally be used occasionally after a number of requests were issued with the <strong>RIO_MSG_DEFER</strong> flag set. This eliminates the need when using the <strong>RIO_MSG_DEFER</strong> flag to make the last request without the <strong>RIO_MSG_DEFER</strong> flag, which causes the last request to complete much slower than other requests. <br/> Unlike other calls to the <strong>RIOReceiveEx</strong> function, when the <strong>RIO_MSG_COMMIT_ONLY</strong> flag is set calls to the <strong>RIOReceiveEx</strong> function do not need to be serialized. For a single [<strong>RIO_RQ</strong>](/windows/win32/winsock/riorqueue), the <strong>RIOReceiveEx</strong> function can be called with <strong>RIO_MSG_COMMIT_ONLY</strong> on one thread while calling the <strong>RIOReceiveEx</strong> function on another thread.<br/></td></tr><tr class="even"><td><span id="RIO_MSG_DONT_NOTIFY"></span><span id="rio_msg_dont_notify"></span><dl> <dt><strong>RIO_MSG_DONT_NOTIFY</strong></dt> </dl></td><td>The request should not trigger the [<strong>RIONotify</strong>](./nc-mswsock-lpfn_rionotify.md) function when request completion is inserted into its completion queue.<br/></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><span id="RIO_MSG_DEFER"></span><span id="rio_msg_defer"></span><dl> <dt><strong>RIO_MSG_DEFER</strong></dt> </dl></td><td>The request does not need to be executed immediately. This will insert the request into the request queue, but it may or may not trigger the execution of the request. <br/> Data reception may be delayed until a receive request is made on the [<strong>RIO_RQ</strong>](/windows/win32/winsock/riorqueue) passed in the <em>SocketQueue</em> parameter without the <strong>RIO_MSG_DEFER</strong> flag set. To trigger execution for all receives in a request queue, call the [<strong>RIOReceive</strong>](./nc-mswsock-lpfn_rioreceive.md) or <strong>RIOReceiveEx</strong> function without the <strong>RIO_MSG_DEFER</strong> flag set. <br/><blockquote>[!Note]<br />
The receive request is charged against the outstanding I/O capacity on the [<strong>RIO_RQ</strong>](/windows/win32/winsock/riorqueue) passed in the <em>SocketQueue</em> parameter regardless of whether <strong>RIO_MSG_DEFER</strong> is set.</blockquote><br/></td></tr><tr class="even"><td><span id="RIO_MSG_WAITALL"></span><span id="rio_msg_waitall"></span><dl> <dt><strong>RIO_MSG_WAITALL</strong></dt> </dl></td><td>The <strong>RIOReceiveEx</strong> function will not complete until one of the following events occurs:<br/><ul><li>The buffer slice supplied by the caller in the <em>pData</em> parameter is completely full.</li><li>The connection has been closed.</li><li>The request has been canceled or an error occurred.</li></ul><br/> This flag is not supported on datagram sockets or on message-oriented connectionless sockets.<br/></td></tr></tbody></table>

### -param RequestContext

The request context to associate with this receive operation.

## -returns

If no error occurs, the **RIOReceiveEx** function returns **TRUE**. In this case, the receive operation is successfully initiated and the completion will have already been queued or the operation has been successfully initiated and the completion will be queued at a later time.

A value of **FALSE** indicates the function failed, the operation was not successfully initiated and no completion indication will be queued. A specific error code can be retrieved by calling the [**WSAGetLastError**](../winsock/nf-winsock-wsagetlasterror.md) function.

## -remarks

An application can use the **RIOReceiveEx** function to receive network data into any buffer completely contained within a single registered buffer. The **Offset** and **Length** members of the [**RIO\_BUF**](../mswsockdef/ns-mswsockdef-rio_buf.md) structure pointed to by the *pData* parameter determine where the network data is received in the buffer.

Once the **RIOReceiveEx** function is called, the buffer passed in the *pData* parameter including the [**RIO\_BUFFERID**](/windows/win32/winsock/rio-bufferid) in the **BufferId** member of [**RIO\_BUF**](../mswsockdef/ns-mswsockdef-rio_buf.md) structure must remain valid for the duration of the receive operation.

In order to avoid race conditions, a buffer associated with a receive request should not be read or written before the request completes. This includes using the buffer as the source for a send request or the destination for another receive request. Portions of a registered buffer not associated with any receive request are not included in this restriction.

The *pLocalAddress* parameter can be used to retrieve the local address where the data was received. The *pRemoteAddress* parameter can be used to retrieve the remote address from which the data was received. The local and remote addresses are returned as [**SOCKADDR\_INET**](../ws2ipdef/ns-ws2ipdef-sockaddr_inet.md) structures. As a result, the **Length** member of the [**RIO\_BUF**](../mswsockdef/ns-mswsockdef-rio_buf.md) pointed to by *pLocalAddress* or *pRemoteAddress* parameters should be equal or greater than the size of a **SOCKADDR\_INET** structure.

The following table summarizes the various uses of control data available for use with the control information in the *pControlContext* member.

The *Flags* parameter can be used to influence the behavior of the **RIOReceiveEx** function invocation beyond the options specified for the associated socket. The behavior of this function is determined by a combination of any socket options set on the socket associated with the *SocketQueue* parameter and the values specified in the *Flags* parameter.

> [!Note]  
> The function pointer to the **RIOReceiveEx** function must be obtained at run time by making a call to the [**WSAIoctl**](../winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl.md) function with the **SIO\_GET\_MULTIPLE\_EXTENSION\_FUNCTION\_POINTER** opcode specified. The input buffer passed to the **WSAIoctl** function must contain **WSAID\_MULTIPLE\_RIO**, a globally unique identifier (GUID) whose value identifies the Winsock registered I/O extension functions. On success, the output returned by the **WSAIoctl** function contains a pointer to the [**RIO\_EXTENSION\_FUNCTION\_TABLE**](./ns-mswsock-rio_extension_function_table.md) structure that contains pointers to the Winsock registered I/O extension functions. The **SIO\_GET\_MULTIPLE\_EXTENSION\_FUNCTION\_POINTER** IOCTL is defined in the *Ws2def.h* header file. The **WSAID\_MULTIPLE\_RIO** GUID is defined in the *Mswsock.h* header file.
