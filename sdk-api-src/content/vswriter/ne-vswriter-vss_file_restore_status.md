# VSS_FILE_RESTORE_STATUS enumeration


## -description

The <b>VSS_FILE_RESTORE_STATUS</b> enumeration 
    defines the set of statuses of a file restore operation performed on the files managed by a 
    selected component or component set (see 
    <a href="/windows/desktop/VSS/working-with-selectability-and-logical-paths">Working with Selectability and 
    Logical Paths</a> for information on selecting components).

## -enum-fields

### -field VSS_RS_UNDEFINED

The restore state is undefined. 
      

This value indicates an error, or indicates that a restore operation has not yet started.

This value is not supported for components that are owned by express writers.

### -field VSS_RS_NONE

No files were restored. 
      

This value indicates an error in restoration that did not leave any restored files on disk.

### -field VSS_RS_ALL

All files were restored. This value indicates success and should be set for each component that was 
      restored successfully.

### -field VSS_RS_FAILED

The restore process failed. 
      

This value indicates an error in restoration that did leave some restored files on disk. This means the 
       components on disk are now corrupt.

## -remarks

If any files managed by a component or, if it defines a component set, any of its subcomponents cannot be 
    restored, the value of <b>VSS_FILE_RESTORE_STATUS</b> 
    must indicate an error.

Both the values <b>VSS_RS_FAILED</b> and <b>VSS_RS_NONE</b> indicate 
    that a restore operation did not complete successfully:

<ul>
<li><b>VSS_RS_NONE</b> indicates a restore failed gracefully: no files from the component 
      or its subcomponents were restored to disk.</li>
<li><b>VSS_RS_FAIL</b> indicates a restore failed gracelessly, leaving some files restored 
      to disk and some files unrestored.</li>
</ul>
Requesters must set a restore status (using 
    <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vsbackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-setfilerestorestatus">IVssBackupComponents::SetFileRestoreStatus</a>) 
    for every component (and its component set, if it defines one) explicitly added for restore to the Backup 
    Components Document (using either 
    <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vsbackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-setselectedforrestore">IVssBackupComponents::SetSelectedForRestore</a> or 
    <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vsbackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-addrestoresubcomponent">IVssBackupComponents::AddRestoreSubcomponent</a>).

Writers and requesters can query the status of the restoration of a component or a component set defined by a 
    selectable component with calls to 
    <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscomponent-getfilerestorestatus">IVssComponent::GetFileRestoreStatus</a>. If
    this method is called for a component that was not selected, the value returned is undefined.
