# CVssWriterEx2 class


## -description


The <b>CVssWriterEx2</b> class is an abstract base class that defines 
    the interface by which a writer synchronizes its state with VSS and other writers.

The <b>CVssWriterEx2</b> class inherits the methods of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-cvsswriterex">CVssWriterEx</a> class.

Every writer must create an instance of the  
    <b>CVssWriterEx2</b>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-cvsswriterex">CVssWriterEx</a>, or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-cvsswriter">CVssWriter</a>  class.

Objects that are derived from <b>CVssWriterEx2</b> must supply implementations 
    for all of the pure virtual methods of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-cvsswriterex">CVssWriterEx</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-cvsswriter">CVssWriter</a> classes.

A writer can override any or all of  the virtual 
    methods of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-cvsswriterex">CVssWriterEx</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-cvsswriter">CVssWriter</a>. However, a writer can override the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onidentify">OnIdentify</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriterex-onidentifyex">OnIdentifyEx</a> method, but not both.

<b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">CVssWriterEx2</b> has these types of members:
