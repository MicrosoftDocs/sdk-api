# IVssComponent::AddPartialFile


## -description


The 
   <b>AddPartialFile</b> method indicates that only
   portions of a given file are to be backed up and which portions those are.

Only a writer can call this method, and only during a backup operation.


## -parameters




### -param wszPath [in]

<b>Null</b>-terminated wide character string containing the path of the file involved in partial file operations. 
     

The path can contain environment variables (for example, %SystemRoot%) but cannot contain wildcard
     characters.

There is no requirement that the path end with a backslash ("\"). It is up to applications that
     retrieve this information to check.

This path should match or be beneath the path of a file set already in the component (or one of its
     subcomponents if the component defines a component set).


### -param wszFilename [in]

<b>Null</b>-terminated wide character string containing the name of the file involved in partial file operations.
     The name of the file (<i>wszFilename</i>) cannot contain wildcard characters (* or ?) and must be consistent with the
     file specification of a file set containing the source path (<i>wszPath</i>).


### -param wszRanges [in]

<b>Null</b>-terminated wide character string containing either a listing of file offsets and lengths that make up
     the partial file support range (the sections of the file to actually be backed up), or the name of a file
     containing such a list. 
     

Specifying the partial file support range is required, and this value cannot be <b>NULL</b>.


### -param wszMetadata [in]

<b>Null</b>-terminated wide character string containing any additional metadata required by a writer to validate a
     partial file restore operation. The information in this metadata string will be opaque to requesters. 
     

If additional metadata is not required, this value can be <b>NULL</b>.


## -returns



The following are the valid return codes for this method.

<table>

<th>Meaning</th>

</td>
<td width="60%">
The method was not called by a writer or, if called by a writer, was not called during a restore
       operation.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



Only a writer can call this method, and the writer cannot call this method during a restore operation.

The syntax of the range listing (<i>wszRanges</i>) is that of a comma-separated list of the form 
   <b>offset1:length1, offset2:length2</b>, where each offset and length is a 64-bit integer
   specifying a byte offset and length in bytes, respectively. The offset and length can be expressed either as
   hexadecimal or decimal values.

If 
   <i>wszRange</i> refers to a file containing all the offsets and lengths (a ranges file), 
   <i>wszRange</i> will contain only the full path to the file.

A ranges file must be a binary file with the following format:

<ol>
<li>A 64-bit integer indicating the number of distinct file ranges that need to be backed up</li>
<li>Each range expressed as a pair of 64-bit integers: the offset into the file being backed up in bytes, and
     the length of data starting from that offset to be backed up</li>
</ol>
In either case, a range indicates a subsection of a given file that is to be backed up, independent of the rest
   of the file.

Requesters can retrieve the partial file information using 
   <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscomponent-getpartialfile">IVssComponent::GetPartialFile</a> and use the
   offset and length information returned by 
   <b>GetPartialFile</b> to restore backed-up sections to
   the appropriate location within the copy of the file on disk at restore time.

<b>AddPartialFile</b> can be applied to a file already
   managed by the component (or one of its subcomponents if the component defines a component set), or it can add a new
   file to the component and indicate that it will participate in partial file operations.

When indicating that the file to participate is a new file, that file must exist on a shadow-copied volume and
   its path (<i>wszPath</i>) should match or be beneath a path already in the component (or one of its
   subcomponents if the component defines a component set). However, the file's file specification (<i>wszFileSpec</i>) should not match one in the components.

Any newly added files will not support alternate location mappings.
