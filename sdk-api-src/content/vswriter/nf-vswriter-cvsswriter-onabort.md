# CVssWriter::OnAbort


## -description


The 
<b>OnAbort</b> method is called by a writer following an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VSS/vssgloss-a">Abort</a> event issued by VSS indicating that a shadow copy operation has terminated prematurely. The writer uses this method to clean up from its attempt to participate in that operation.

<b>OnAbort</b> is a pure virtual method. It is not implemented by the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-cvsswriter">CVssWriter</a> base class, and must be implemented by derived classes.


## -parameters






## -returns



The implementation of this method should return <b>true</b> except in the case of a fatal error. If a fatal error occurs, the method must call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-setwriterfailure">CVssWriter::SetWriterFailure</a> method to provide a description of the failure before returning <b>false</b>. If a nonfatal error occurs, the method should still call <b>SetWriterFailure</b> but return <b>true</b>. If the error is caused by a transient problem, the method should specify VSS_E_WRITERERROR_RETRYABLE in the call to <b>SetWriterFailure</b>.

  In all cases when a failure occurs, the method should write an event to the event log to report the exact reason for the failure.




## -remarks



In this method, the writer should free all temporary system resources it created when preparing to participate with a VSS operation.

The writer will not receive further event notifications related to the VSS operation it was participating in after 
<b>CVssWriter::OnAbort</b> has been executed.

This method will not be called if the writer has called 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onpostsnapshot">CVssWriter::OnPostSnapshot</a> (that is, received notification of the end of a shadow copy).

An Abort event is generated when:

<ul>
<li>A writer's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VSS/vssgloss-f">Freeze</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VSS/vssgloss-t">Thaw</a> event handlers (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onfreeze">CVssWriter::OnFreeze</a> and 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onthaw">CVssWriter::OnThaw</a>) return <b>false</b>, or cannot complete in the time window specified in 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-initialize">CVssWriter::Initialize</a>.</li>
<li>A requester explicitly generates an Abort event by calling 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vsbackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-abortbackup">IVssBackupComponents::AbortBackup</a>.</li>
<li>There is any failure of the provider or VSS during the creation of a shadow copy following the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VSS/vssgloss-p">PrepareForSnapshot</a> event.</li>
</ul>
Writers should never throw an exception from this method or any other <b>CVssWriter(Ex)::On<i>Xxx</i></b> callback method.

If this method calls the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriterex2-getsessionid">CVssWriterEx2::GetSessionId</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-setwriterfailure">CVssWriter::SetWriterFailure</a>, or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriterex2-setwriterfailureex">CVssWriterEx2::SetWriterFailureEx</a> method, it must do so in  the same thread that called this method. For more information, see 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VSS/writers">Writer Event Handling</a>.
