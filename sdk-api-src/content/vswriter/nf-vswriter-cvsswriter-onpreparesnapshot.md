# CVssWriter::OnPrepareSnapshot


## -description

The 
<b>OnPrepareSnapshot</b> method is called by a writer to handle a <a href="/windows/desktop/VSS/vssgloss-p">PrepareForSnapshot</a> event. It is used to perform operations needed to prepare a writer to participate in the shadow copy or to veto a shadow copy.

<b>OnPrepareSnapshot</b> is a pure virtual method. It is not implemented by the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-cvsswriter">CVssWriter</a> base class, and must be implemented by derived classes.

## -parameters

## -returns

The implementation of this method must return <b>true</b> except in the case of a fatal error.
      If a fatal error occurs, the method must call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-setwriterfailure">CVssWriter::SetWriterFailure</a> method to provide a description of the failure before returning <b>false</b>. If a nonfatal error occurs, the method should still call  <b>SetWriterFailure</b> but return <b>true</b>. If the error is caused by a transient problem, the method should specify VSS_E_WRITERERROR_RETRYABLE in the call to <b>SetWriterFailure</b>.

  In all cases when a failure occurs, the method should write an event to the event log to report the exact reason for the failure.

## -remarks

The 
<b>OnPrepareSnapshot</b> method performs operations that are required prior to any shadow copy freeze.

The time-out window for handling a <a href="/windows/desktop/VSS/vssgloss-p">PrepareForSnapshot</a> event is typically longer than that for handling a <a href="/windows/desktop/VSS/vssgloss-f">Freeze</a> event. Therefore, developers can use 
<b>OnPrepareSnapshot</b> to handle more time-consuming operations. A typical use might be for the writer to explicitly checkpoint its data.

Writers should never throw an exception from this method or any other <b>CVssWriter(Ex)::On<i>Xxx</i></b> callback method.

If this method calls the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriterex2-getsessionid">CVssWriterEx2::GetSessionId</a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-setwriterfailure">CVssWriter::SetWriterFailure</a>, or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriterex2-setwriterfailureex">CVssWriterEx2::SetWriterFailureEx</a> method, it must do so in  the same thread that called this method. For more information, see 
<a href="/windows/desktop/VSS/writers">Writer Event Handling</a>.
