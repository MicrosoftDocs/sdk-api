# CVssWriter::OnPrepareBackup


## -description


The 
<b>OnPrepareBackup</b> method is called by a writer following a 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vsbackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-prepareforbackup">PrepareForBackup</a> event. This method is used to configure a writer's state and its components in preparation for a backup operation.

<b>OnPrepareBackup</b> is a virtual method. It is implemented by the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-cvsswriter">CVssWriter</a> base class, but can be overridden by derived classes.


## -parameters




### -param pComponent [in]

Pointer to an instantiation of an 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-ivsswritercomponents">IVssWriterComponents</a> object containing the contents of the Writer Metadata Document. The value of this parameter may be <b>NULL</b> if the requester does not support components (if 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-arecomponentsselected">CVssWriter::AreComponentsSelected</a> returns <b>false</b>).


## -returns



As implemented by the base class, 
<b>OnPrepareBackup</b> always returns <b>true</b>.

Any other implementation of this method must return <b>true</b> except in the case of a fatal error.
      If a fatal error occurs, the method must call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-setwriterfailure">CVssWriter::SetWriterFailure</a> method to provide a description of the failure before returning <b>false</b>. If a nonfatal error occurs, the method should still call <b>SetWriterFailure</b> but return <b>true</b>. If the error is caused by a transient problem, the method should specify VSS_E_WRITERERROR_RETRYABLE in the call to <b>SetWriterFailure</b>.

  In all cases when a failure occurs, the method should write an event to the event log to report the exact reason for the failure.




## -remarks



The default implementation of this method by the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-cvsswriter">CVssWriter</a> base class returns <b>true</b> without performing any other operation.

<b>OnPrepareBackup</b> provides a writer an opportunity to more finely select what will be backed up.

Handling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VSS/vssgloss-p">PrepareForBackup</a> event is the last opportunity for a writer to get access to metadata contained in the Backup Components Document prior to the shadow copy's creation.

Therefore, 
<b>OnPrepareBackup</b> provides an opportunity for the writer to make any final additions or updates to stored component information (using the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-ivsscomponent">IVssComponent</a> interface). In particular, writer-specific metadata can be updated by 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscomponent-setbackupmetadata">IVssComponent::SetBackupMetadata</a> or 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscomponent-setrestoremetadata">IVssComponent::SetRestoreMetadata</a>.

In addition, while handling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VSS/vssgloss-p">PrepareForSnapshot</a> event provides another opportunity in the life cycle of a VSS backup operation to perform time-consuming operations (such as synchronizing data across multiple sites), 
<b>OnPrepareBackup</b> provides a chance for the writer to start such an operation asynchronously. Tasks like these must be completed prior to the return of 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onpreparesnapshot">CVssWriter::OnPrepareSnapshot</a>.

Writers should never throw an exception from this method or any other <b>CVssWriter(Ex)::On<i>Xxx</i></b> callback method.

A requester generates a 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vsbackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-prepareforbackup">PrepareForBackup</a> event, triggering a call to 
<b>OnPrepareBackup</b>, by calling 
<b>IVssBackupComponents::PrepareForBackup</b>.

If this method calls the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriterex2-getsessionid">CVssWriterEx2::GetSessionId</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-setwriterfailure">CVssWriter::SetWriterFailure</a>, or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriterex2-setwriterfailureex">CVssWriterEx2::SetWriterFailureEx</a> method, it must do so in  the same thread that called this method. For more information, see 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VSS/writers">Writer Event Handling</a>.
