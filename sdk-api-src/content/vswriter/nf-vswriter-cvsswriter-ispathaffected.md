# CVssWriter::IsPathAffected


## -description


The <b>IsPathAffected</b> method determines whether 
    the specified directory or file is included in the current shadow copy set.  The path for the directory or file can be a local path or a UNC path of a remote file share.

<b>IsPathAffected</b> is a protected method 
    implemented by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-cvsswriter">CVssWriter</a> base class.


## -parameters




### -param wszPath [in]

Path of the directory or file to be queried. 
       This path can be a local path or a UNC path of a remote file share.

If the path refers to a directory, it can contain environment variables (for example, %SystemRoot%) but 
       cannot contain wildcard characters.


## -returns



The following are the valid return codes for this method.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>true</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The path is included in the set of volumes being included in the shadow copy set.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>false</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The path is not included in the set of volumes being included in the shadow copy set.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



<b>Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003:  </b>Remote file shares are not supported until Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012. Writers support only local resources—sets of files whose absolute path starts with a 
    valid local volume specification and cannot be a mapped network drive. The input to 
    <b>IsPathAffected</b> (after the resolution of any 
    environment variables) must be in this format.
