# CVssWriter class


## -description

The <b>CVssWriter</b> class is an abstract base class that defines 
    the interface by which a writer synchronizes its state with VSS and other writers.

Every writer must instantiate an object derived from 
    <b>CVssWriter</b>.

Objects derived from <b>CVssWriter</b> must supply implementations 
    for all of the <b>CVssWriter</b>'s pure virtual methods.

A writer can override one or all of <b>CVssWriter</b>'s virtual 
    methods.

To participate in VSS, a writer must first call 
    <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-initialize">CVssWriter::Initialize</a> and then call 
    <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-subscribe">CVssWriter::Subscribe</a>.

A writer terminates its participation by calling 
    <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-unsubscribe">CVssWriter::Unsubscribe</a>.

The <b>CVssWriter</b> base class is responsible for the life cycle 
    of interfaces passed to event handlers. This includes the following:
<ul>
<li>The instance of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-ivsswritercomponents">IVssWriterComponents</a> 
     interface passed to:
     
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onpreparebackup">CVssWriter::OnPrepareBackup</a>



<a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onbackupcomplete">CVssWriter::OnBackupComplete</a>



<a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onprerestore">CVssWriter::OnPreRestore</a>



<a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onpostrestore">CVssWriter::OnPostRestore</a>



<a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onpostsnapshot">CVssWriter::OnPostSnapshot</a>


</li>
<li>The instance of the 
     <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-ivsscreatewritermetadata">IVssCreateWriterMetadata</a> interface passed to 
     <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onidentify">CVssWriter::OnIdentify</a>.</li>
