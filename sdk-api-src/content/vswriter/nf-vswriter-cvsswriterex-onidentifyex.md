# CVssWriterEx::OnIdentifyEx


## -description

Returns a pointer to an 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-ivsscreatewritermetadataex">IVssCreateWriterMetadataEx</a> object.

<b>OnIdentifyEx</b> is a virtual method. It is implemented by the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-cvsswriterex">CVssWriterEx</a> base class, but can be overridden by derived classes.

## -parameters

### -param pMetadata [in]

A pointer to an 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-ivsscreatewritermetadataex">IVssCreateWriterMetadataEx</a> object.

## -returns

As implemented by the base class, 
<b>OnIdentifyEx</b> always returns <b>true</b>.

Any other implementation of this method must return <b>true</b> except in the case of a fatal error.
      If a fatal error occurs, the method should return <b>false</b>.

  In all cases when a failure occurs, including nonfatal errors, the method should write a detailed entry to the event log to report the exact reason for the failure.

## -remarks

The <b>OnIdentifyEx</b> method is identical to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onidentify">OnIdentify</a> method, except that it returns an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-ivsscreatewritermetadataex">IVssCreateWriterMetadataEx</a> interface pointer instead of an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-ivsscreatewritermetadata">IVssCreateWriterMetadata</a> interface pointer in the <i>pMetadata</i> parameter. A writer can override <b>OnIdentify</b> or <b>OnIdentifyEx</b>, but not both.

Writers should never throw an exception from this method or any other <b>CVssWriter(Ex)::On<i>Xxx</i></b> callback method.

Writers should never call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-setwriterfailure">CVssWriter::SetWriterFailure</a> method from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onidentify">OnIdentify</a> or <b>OnIdentifyEx</b> method.

If this method calls the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriterex2-getsessionid">CVssWriterEx2::GetSessionId</a> method, it must do so in  the same thread that called this method. For more information, see 
<a href="/windows/desktop/VSS/writers">Writer Event Handling</a>.

In response to an <a href="/windows/desktop/VSS/vssgloss-i">Identify</a> event that is generated by another application, a writer calls <b>OnIdentifyEx</b> to create a <a href="/windows/desktop/VSS/vssgloss-w">Writer Metadata Document</a> that contains information about the components it manages using the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-ivsscreatewritermetadata">IVssCreateWriterMetadataEx</a> interface.

The application that generated the <a href="/windows/desktop/VSS/vssgloss-i">Identify</a> event then retrieves the <a href="/windows/desktop/VSS/vssgloss-w">Writer Metadata Document</a> and examines the writer's component information using the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/vsbackup/nl-vsbackup-ivssexaminewritermetadata">IVssExamineWriterMetadata</a> interface.

An <a href="/windows/desktop/VSS/vssgloss-i">Identify</a> event is required before the events that make up a backup or restore sequence. Therefore, <b>OnIdentifyEx</b> is typically called to handle an <i>Identify</i> event in response to a requester's call to 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/vsbackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-gatherwritermetadata">IVssBackupComponents::GatherWriterMetadata</a> as part of a backup or restore operation.

However, an <a href="/windows/desktop/VSS/vssgloss-i">Identify</a> event by itself is not part of the sequence of events that make up a backup or restore sequence, and the VSS service does not prevent <i>Identify</i> events from being generated, even while a backup or restore sequence is in progress. For example, VSS management applications use the <i>Identify</i> event to determine and display the state of the writers on the system.

For this reason, writers should never use their implementation of <b>OnIdentifyEx</b> in any of the following ways:

<ul>
<li>As the beginning of their handling of a backup or restore sequence</li>
<li>To set or maintain information about the writer's state</li>
</ul>
For more information about writer interactions with events, see 
<a href="/windows/desktop/VSS/writers">Writer Event Handling</a>.

 During the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vsbackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-prepareforbackup">PrepareForBackup</a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/VSS/vssgloss-p">PrepareForSnapshot</a>, and <a href="/windows/desktop/VSS/vssgloss-p">PostSnapshot</a> events, a writer can use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriterex-getidentifyinformation">GetIdentifyInformation</a> method to get the metadata that the writer's <b>OnIdentifyEx</b> method previously reported.

The life cycle of the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-ivsscreatewritermetadataex">IVssCreateWriterMetadataEx</a> object that the <i>pMetadata</i> parameter points to is managed by the VSS infrastructure.
