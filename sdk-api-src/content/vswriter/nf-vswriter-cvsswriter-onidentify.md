# CVssWriter::OnIdentify


## -description

The 
<b>OnIdentify</b> method is called by a writer following receipt of an <a href="/windows/desktop/VSS/vssgloss-i">Identify</a> event.

<b>OnIdentify</b> is a virtual method. It is implemented by the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-cvsswriter">CVssWriter</a> base class, but can be overridden by derived classes.

## -parameters

### -param pMetadata [in]

A pointer to an 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-ivsscreatewritermetadata">IVssCreateWriterMetadata</a> object used to construct the writer's metadata.

## -returns

As implemented by the base class, 
<b>OnIdentify</b> always returns <b>true</b>.

Any other implementation of this method must return <b>true</b> except in the case of a fatal error.
      If a fatal error occurs, the method should return <b>false</b>.

  In all cases when a failure occurs, including nonfatal errors, the method should write a detailed entry to the event log to report the exact reason for the failure.

## -remarks

The default implementation of this method by the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-cvsswriter">CVssWriter</a> base class returns <b>true</b> without performing any other operation.

Writers should never throw an exception from this method or any other <b>CVssWriter(Ex)::On<i>Xxx</i></b> callback method.

Writers should never call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-setwriterfailure">CVssWriter::SetWriterFailure</a> method from the <b>OnIdentify</b> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriterex-onidentifyex">CVssWriterEx::OnIdentifyEx</a> method.

If this method calls the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriterex2-getsessionid">CVssWriterEx2::GetSessionId</a> method, it must do so in  the same thread that called this method. For more information, see 
<a href="/windows/desktop/VSS/writers">Writer Event Handling</a>.

In response to an Identify event generated by another application, a writer uses the <b>OnIdentify</b> handler to create a Writer Metadata Document containing information about the components it manages using the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-ivsscreatewritermetadata">IVssCreateWriterMetadata</a> interface.

The application that generated the Identify event then retrieves the Writer Metadata Document and examines the writer's component information using the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/vsbackup/nl-vsbackup-ivssexaminewritermetadata">IVssExamineWriterMetadata</a> interface.

An Identify event is required before the events that make up a backup or restore sequence. Therefore, <b>OnIdentify</b> is perhaps most typically invoked to handle an Identify event in response to a requester's call to 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/vsbackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-gatherwritermetadata">IVssBackupComponents::GatherWriterMetadata</a> as part of a backup or restore operation.

However, an Identify event is not itself part of the sequence of events that makes up a backup or restore and the VSS service does not prevent its generation, even while a backup or restore sequence is in progress. For instance, VSS management applications use the Identify event to determine and display the state of the writers on the system.

This being the case, writers should never use their implementation of <b>OnIdentify</b> in the following ways:

<ul>
<li>As the beginning of their handling of a backup or restore</li>
<li>To set or maintain information about the writer's state</li>
</ul>
See 
<a href="/windows/desktop/VSS/writers">Writer Event Handling</a> for more information on writer interactions with events.

The life cycle of the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nl-vswriter-ivsscreatewritermetadata">IVssCreateWriterMetadata</a> object passed into <b>OnIdentify</b> is managed by the VSS infrastructure.
