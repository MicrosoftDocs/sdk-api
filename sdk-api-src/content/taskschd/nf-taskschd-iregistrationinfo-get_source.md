# IRegistrationInfo::get_Source


## -description


Gets or sets where the task originated from. For example, a task may originate from a component, service, application, or user.

This property is read/write.


## -parameters


## -remarks



The Task Scheduler UI uses the source to sort tasks. For example, tasks could be sorted by component, service, application, or user.

When reading or writing XML for a task, the task source information is specified using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/174e2aac-7cd0-4c19-9441-2c93a3260c6f">Source</a> element of the Task Scheduler schema.

When setting this property value, the value can be text that is retrieved from a resource .dll file. A specialized string is used to reference the text from the resource file.  The format of the string is $(@ [Dll], [ResourceID]) where [Dll] is the path to the .dll file that contains the resource and [ResourceID] is the identifier for the resource text. For example, the setting this property value to $(@ %SystemRoot%\System32\ResourceName.dll, -101) will set the property to the value of the resource text  with an identifier equal to -101 in the  %SystemRoot%\System32\ResourceName.dll file.
