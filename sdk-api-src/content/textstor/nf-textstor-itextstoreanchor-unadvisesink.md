## -remarks



Every call to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/textstor/nf-textstor-itextstoreanchor-advisesink">ITextStoreAnchor::AdviseSink</a> method, which registers a new sink object, should be matched by a call to this method. If AdviseSink has only updated the <i>dwMask</i> parameter of a sink which was previously registered, a call to <b>UnadviseSink</b> is not required.

For example, to register a sink object, an application calls the <b>AdviseSink</b> method the first time. The application can then call the <b>AdviseSink</b> method again with the same sink object to change the <i>dwMask</i> parameter. To unregister the sink object, an application calls the <b>UnadviseSink</b> method.

The <i>punk</i> parameter must have the same COM identity as the pointer originally passed in the <b>AdviseSink</b> method.
