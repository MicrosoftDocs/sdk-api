# TS_SELECTIONSTYLE structure


## -description

The <b>TS_SELECTIONSTYLE</b> structure represents the style of a selection.

## -struct-fields

### -field ase

Specifies the active end of the selection. For more information, see <a href="/windows/win32/api/textstor/ne-textstor-tsactiveselend">TsActiveSelEnd</a>.

### -field fInterimChar

Indicates if the selection is an interim character. If this value is nonzero, then the seleciton is an interim character and <b>ase</b> will be TS_AE_NONE. If this value is zero, the selection is not an interim character.

## -remarks

An interim character selection is the length of one character and is visually represented as a solid rectangle that is usually flashing. This is a standard UI element of Korean and some Chinese character compositions. <b>fInterimChar</b> is an indication that a specific character is being composed. <b>fInterimChar</b> can only be nonzero for a single selection. In this case, there will be no caret because the highlight takes its place.
