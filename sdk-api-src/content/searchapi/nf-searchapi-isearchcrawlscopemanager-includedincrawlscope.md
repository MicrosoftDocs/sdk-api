# ISearchCrawlScopeManager::IncludedInCrawlScope


## -description

Retrieves an indicator of whether the specified URL is included in the crawl scope.

## -parameters

### -param pszURL [in]

Type: <b>LPCWSTR</b>

A string containing the URL to check for inclusion in the crawl scope.

### -param pfIsIncluded [out, retval]

Type: <b>BOOL*</b>

A pointer to a <b>BOOL</b> value: <b>TRUE</b> if <i>pszURL</i> is included in the crawl scope; otherwise, <b>FALSE</b>.

## -returns

Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

## -remarks

For hierarchical sources, the most immediate parent is included. For non-hierarchical sources like URLs, this will be only the URL rule itself. Other URLs that might be indexed will cause this method to retrieve <b>FALSE</b> because there is no way to tell whether they are in the scope.

<b>Windows 7 and later</b>: Check out the <a href="/windows/win32/search/-search-sample-crawlscopecommandline">CrawlScopeCommandLine code sample</a> to see how to define command line options for Crawl Scope Manager (CSM) indexing operations.
