# ProcessTraceBufferIncrementReference function

## -description

Called during the [BufferCallback](nc-evntrace-petw_buffer_callback.md) on the provided Buffer to prevent it from being freed until the caller is done with it.

## -parameters

### -param TraceHandle

The processing session that this *Buffer* came from.

### -param Buffer

The buffer to reference. This buffer must have been obtained by a call to the [PETW_BUFFER_CALLBACK](nc-evntrace-petw_buffer_callback.md) callback.

## -returns

Win32 Error Code. Possible codes may include ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER and ERROR_OUTOFMEMORY.

## -remarks

If **ProcessTraceBufferIncrementReference** is not called on a Buffer during the [PETW_BUFFER_CALLBACK](nc-evntrace-petw_buffer_callback.md) then the memory is no longer accessible after the [PETW_BUFFER_CALLBACK](nc-evntrace-petw_buffer_callback.md) returns.

The caller is responsible for calling **ProcessTraceBufferDecrementReference** on the Buffer once they are done with it. [ProcessTrace](nf-evntrace-processtrace.md) will not return until this has been done for every buffer that was incremented.

**ProcessTraceBufferIncrementReference** is not supported for buffers provided by a processing session opened by [OpenTraceFromBufferStream](nf-evntrace-opentracefrombufferstream.md).
