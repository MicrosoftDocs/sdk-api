# OpenTraceFromBufferStream function

## -description

Creates a trace processing session that is not directly attached to any file or active session.

## -parameters

### -param Options

Configuration options for this processing session. See [ETW_OPEN_TRACE_OPTIONS](ns-evntrace-etw_open_trace_options.md) for more details

### -param BufferCompletionCallback

When the processing session is done with a buffer passed in from [ProcessTraceAddBufferToBufferStream](nf-evntrace-processtraceaddbuffertobufferstream.md), it will invoke this callback to allow for any freeing or other cleanup that may be required for that buffer.

### -param BufferCompletionContext

User-provided context that will be passed to the [BufferCompletionCallback](nc-evntrace-petw_buffer_completion_callback.md).

## -returns

A TRACEHANDLE that is used to identify this processing session. Typically passed to [ProcessTrace](nf-evntrace-processtrace.md) to begin processing and to [CloseTrace](nf-evntrace-closetrace.md) to end processing.

## -remarks

The caller is expected to supply the data for the trace by calling [ProcessTraceAddBufferToBufferStream](nf-evntrace-processtraceaddbuffertobufferstream.md). This is typically used for remote real-time trace processing: a remote system uses [OpenTraceFromRealTimeLogger](nf-evntrace-opentracefromrealtimelogger.md) and [ProcessTrace](nf-evntrace-processtrace.md) with a [BufferCallback](nc-evntrace-petw_buffer_callback.md) that sends buffers over the network to a local system, then the local system calls [OpenTraceFromBufferStream](nf-evntrace-opentracefrombufferstream.md) and [ProcessTrace](nf-evntrace-processtrace.md), receives buffers from the network and feeds them to the local trace processor using [ProcessTraceAddBufferToBufferStream](nf-evntrace-processtraceaddbuffertobufferstream.md).

This processing mode requires that the buffers be provided in the same order that the buffers were received from [ProcessTrace](nf-evntrace-processtrace.md) (for example, the first buffer contains header information and subsequent buffers are ordered by flush time). The only supported means to generate buffers in this way is from the [BufferCallback](nc-evntrace-petw_buffer_callback.md) from another [OpenTraceFromBufferStream](nf-evntrace-opentracefrombufferstream.md), [OpenTraceFromFile](nf-evntrace-opentracefromfile.md), [OpenTraceFromRealTimeLogger](nf-evntrace-opentracefromrealtimelogger.md), [OpenTraceFromRealTimeLoggerWithAllocationOptions](nf-evntrace-opentracefromrealtimeloggerwithallocationoptions.md) processing session.
