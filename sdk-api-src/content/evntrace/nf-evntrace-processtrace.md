# ProcessTrace function

## -description

The **ProcessTrace** function delivers events from one or more ETW trace
processing sessions to the consumer.

## -parameters

### -param HandleArray [in]

Pointer to an array of trace processing session handles obtained from earlier
calls to the [OpenTrace](/windows/win32/api/evntrace/nf-evntrace-opentracea)
function.

The array can contain up to 64 handles to file processing sessions or it can
contain one handle to a real-time processing session. The array cannot contain
both file processing session handles and real-time processing session handles.

### -param HandleCount [in]

Number of elements in _HandleArray_.

### -param StartTime [in]

Pointer to an optional
[FILETIME](/windows/win32/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-filetime) structure that
specifies the beginning time period for which you want to receive events. The
function does not deliver events with timestamps prior to _StartTime_.

### -param EndTime [in]

Pointer to an optional
[FILETIME](/windows/win32/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-filetime) structure that
specifies the ending time period for which you want to receive events. The
function does not deliver events with timestamps after _EndTime_.

**Windows Server 2003:** This value is ignored for real-time event delivery.

## -returns

If the function succeeds, the return value is ERROR_SUCCESS.

If the function fails, the return value is one of the
[system error codes](/windows/win32/debug/system-error-codes). The following are
some common errors and their causes.

- **ERROR_BAD_LENGTH**

  _HandleCount_ is not valid or the number of handles is greater than 64.

- **ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE**

  An element of _HandleArray_ is not a valid event tracing session handle.

- **ERROR_INVALID_TIME**

  _EndTime_ is less than _StartTime_.

- **ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER**

  _HandleArray_ is **NULL**, contains both file processing sessions and
  real-time processing sessions, or contains more than one real-time processing
  session.

- **ERROR_NOACCESS**

  An exception occurred in one of the callback functions that receives the
  events.

- **ERROR_CANCELLED**

  Indicates the consumer canceled processing by returning **FALSE** in their
  [BufferCallback](/windows/win32/api/evntrace/nc-evntrace-pevent_trace_buffer_callbacka)
  function.

- **ERROR_WMI_INSTANCE_NOT_FOUND**

  The trace collection session from which you are trying to consume events in
  real time is not running or does not have the real-time trace mode enabled.

## -remarks

Trace consumers call this function to process the events from one or more trace
processing sessions. This function blocks until processing ends.

Before calling **ProcessTrace**, use
[OpenTrace](/windows/win32/api/evntrace/nf-evntrace-opentracea) to open handles
to trace processing sessions.

The **ProcessTrace** function delivers the events from the sessions by invoking
the consumer's
[BufferCallback](/windows/win32/api/evntrace/nc-evntrace-pevent_trace_buffer_callbacka),
[EventCallback](/windows/win32/api/evntrace/nc-evntrace-pevent_callback), and
[EventRecordCallback](/windows/win32/api/evntrace/nc-evntrace-pevent_record_callback)
callback functions.

The **ProcessTrace** function attempts to deliver events in order based on the
event's timestamp (i.e. it tries to deliver events oldest to newest). In certain
cases, **ProcessTrace** might deliver events out of order.

- If the clock used for the event timestamps is adjusted backwards during trace
  collection, the delivery order of the events is unpredictable. To avoid this
  issue, [use the QPC clock](/windows/win32/etw/wnode-header) instead of the
  system time clock when collecting the trace.
- If multiple events are collected with the same timestamp on different CPUs,
  the delivery order of the events is unpredictable.
- If an event has an invalid timestamp (e.g. due to file corruption), the
  delivery order of that event and other events in the trace may be
  unpredictable.

The **ProcessTrace** function blocks the thread until it delivers all events,
the
[BufferCallback](/windows/win32/api/evntrace/nc-evntrace-pevent_trace_buffer_callbacka)
function returns **FALSE**, or you call
[CloseTrace](/windows/win32/api/evntrace/nf-evntrace-closetrace). In addition,
if the consumer is consuming events in real time, the **ProcessTrace** function
returns after the controller stops the trace session. (Note that there may be a
delay of several seconds before the function returns.)

**Windows Server 2003:** You can call
[CloseTrace](/windows/win32/api/evntrace/nf-evntrace-closetrace) only after
**ProcessTrace** returns.
