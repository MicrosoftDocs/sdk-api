# EVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES structure

## -description

The **EVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES** structure contains information about an event
tracing session. You use this structure with APIs such as
[StartTrace](/windows/win32/api/evntrace/nf-evntrace-starttracea) and
[ControlTrace](/windows/win32/api/evntrace/nf-evntrace-controltracea) when
defining, updating, or querying the properties of a session.

> [!Note]
> This is a version-1 structure. Additional options are supported by
> [EVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES_V2](/windows/win32/api/evntrace/ns-evntrace-event_trace_properties_v2)
> (e.g. **FilterDesc** and **V2Options**).

## -struct-fields

### -field Wnode

A [WNODE_HEADER](/windows/win32/etw/wnode-header) structure. You must specify
the **BufferSize**, **Flags**, and **Guid** members. You may optionally specify
the **ClientContext** member.

### -field BufferSize

Kilobytes of memory allocated for each event tracing session buffer. The minimum
buffer size is 4 (4KB). The maximum buffer size is 16384 (16MB). Most trace
sessions should use a buffer size of 64KB or less to avoid wasting memory and
disk space. **Prior to Windows 8:** The maximum buffer size is 1024 (1MB).

Smaller buffer sizes reduce session memory usage and can help reduce log file
size. Larger buffer sizes support collection of larger events because ETW does
not fragment events across buffer boundaries and therefore cannot collect events
larger than the buffer size. In scenarios involving extremely high data
throughput, larger buffer sizes can also reduce CPU overhead.

- A session with small events and a low event rate (a few KB/s) should use a
  small buffer size (4KB to 16KB).
- A session with small events and a moderate event rate should use a medium
  buffer size (16KB to 32KB).
- A session with large events or a high event rate (a few MB/s) should use a
  large buffer size (64KB to 128KB).
- In rare cases when a large amount of memory should be reserved for a
  diagnostic trace with hundreds of megabytes of data per second, a huge buffer
  size (256KB to 1024KB) can reduce CPU overhead.

> [!Note]
> Regardless of buffer size, ETW cannot collect events larger than 64KB.

ETW may adjust the requested **BufferSize** upwards in certain scenarios. For
example, when writing a trace file to a disk, ETW may increase the buffer size
to a multiple of the disk's physical block size.

> [!Important]
> **BufferSize** is one of the most important parameters for a
> trace session. Large buffers usually waste memory and disk space. Trace
> sessions with large buffers (256KB or larger) should be used only for
> diagnostic investigations or testing, not for production tracing.

> [!Tip]
> Do not use **BufferSize** to control the trace session's memory usage.
> Instead, select the buffer size based on your session's event size and event
> rate, then use the **MinimumBuffers** and **MaximumBuffers** parameters to
> adjust session memory usage.

### -field MinimumBuffers

Minimum number of buffers reserved for the tracing session's buffer pool.

ETW may adjust this value in certain scenarios.

- If the logging mode includes the `EVENT_TRACE_NO_PER_PROCESSOR_BUFFERING`
  flag, ETW will reserve at least 2 buffers.
- If the logging mode does not include the
  `EVENT_TRACE_NO_PER_PROCESSOR_BUFFERING` flag, ETW will reserve at least 2
  buffers for each logical processor.
- If this value is larger than an ETW-determined limit, ETW may reduce it to the
  limit to avoid excessive memory usage.

For file-mode and real-time traces with moderate event rates, most users should
minimize memory usage by setting **MinimumBuffers** to 0 or to a small minimum
(e.g. 4 or 8), allowing ETW to adjust the value upwards based on the number of
processors. ETW will reserve the (adjusted) minimum number of buffers when the
trace is started. If the buffers are filled more quickly than they can be
processed, ETW will try to allocate addition buffers, up the the number
specified by **MaximumBuffers**.

For buffering-mode (circular in-memory) traces, users should set the
**MinimumBuffers** parameter according to the total amount of memory that you
want ETW to reserve for the session. This is usually calculated based on the
expected event rate and the amount of time you want the trace to cover. For
example, if you expect a data rate of 16KB per second and you want your trace to
record at least 60 seconds of data, you would need 960KB. Assuming a buffer size
of 32KB, you would set **MinimumBuffers** to 30 (960KB total / 32KB per buffer =
30 buffers). ETW will reserve the (adjusted) minimum number of buffers when the
trace is started. When all buffers are filled, ETW will reuse the oldest filled
buffer for new events. Note that ETW will not allocate additional buffers (ETW
ignores **MaximumBuffers** for buffering-mode traces).

### -field MaximumBuffers

Maximum number of buffers to be allocated for the tracing session's buffer pool.

ETW may adjust this value in certain scenarios.

- If this value is less than the adjusted value of **MinimumBuffers**, ETW may
  increase it to a suitable value equal to or larger than **MinimumBuffers**.
- If this value is larger than an ETW-determined limit, ETW may reduce it to the
  limit.

Most users should start tuning their session by setting **MinimumBuffers** and
**MaximumBuffers** to the same value. You might then increase the value of
**MaximumBuffers** if the trace drops events during event rate peaks.

ETW cannot allocate on-demand buffers if the event is generated by a driver
running at high IRQL. If your trace session needs to record events from
high-IRQL kernel-mode providers, it may need to use a higher value of
**MinimumBuffers** to force the buffers to be preallocated.

> [!Note]
> ETW ignores **MaximumBuffers** for buffering-mode sessions (sessions
> that include logging mode `EVENT_TRACE_BUFFERING_MODE`). Buffering-mode
> sessions always allocate **MinimumBuffers** at the start of the trace
> collection and never allocate additional buffers.

### -field MaximumFileSize

Maximum size of the file used to log events, in megabytes, or zero for no size
limit. Typically, you use this member to limit the size of a circular log file
when you set **LogFileMode** to `EVENT_TRACE_FILE_MODE_CIRCULAR`. This member
must be set to a nonzero value if **LogFileMode** contains
`EVENT_TRACE_FILE_MODE_PREALLOCATE`, `EVENT_TRACE_FILE_MODE_CIRCULAR` or
`EVENT_TRACE_FILE_MODE_NEWFILE`.

If you are using the system drive (the drive that contains the operating system)
for logging, ETW checks for an additional 200MB of disk space, regardless of
whether you are using the maximum file size parameter. Therefore, if you specify
100MB as the maximum file size for the trace file in the system drive, you need
to have 300MB of free space on the drive.

### -field LogFileMode

Logging flags for the event tracing session. You use this member to specify
whether you want events written to an in-memory circular buffer, a log file, or
a real-time consumer. You can also use this member to specify other session
characteristics, e.g. that the session is a private logger session. For a list
of possible flags, see
[Logging Mode Constants](/windows/win32/etw/logging-mode-constants).

ETW buffers events for real-time sessions when there are no real-time consumers
for the session. Note that this buffering is limited. If the limit is reached,
new events will be ignored and the logging functions fail with
`STATUS_LOG_FILE_FULL`. **Prior to Windows Vista:** If there is no real-time
consumer, events are discarded and logging continues.

Do not start a real-time logging session unless a real-time consumer will
consume the events. A real-time session with no consumers will waste system
resources (CPU, memory, and disk space for buffering the events).

If a consumer begins processing real-time events, the buffered events are
consumed first. After all buffered events are consumed, the session will begin
reporting new events.

### -field FlushTimer

How often, in seconds, any non-empty trace buffers are flushed. The minimum
flush time is 1 second.

- For file-mode sessions: Setting **FlushTimer** to 0 will disable time-based
  flushes (flush will occur when the buffer is filled, when the session is
  stopped, or when the session is explicitly flushed). Most file-mode traces
  should set **FlushTimer** to 0 to avoid wasted space in the trace file (i.e.
  so that disk space is not wasted storing mostly-empty buffers). You might want
  to set the timer to a non-zero value if there is a chance the trace might not
  be closed (e.g. if you want to be sure to get events even if the system
  crashes).
- For real-time sessions: Setting **FlushTimer** to 0 will enable a default
  timeout of 1 second. Real-time sessions should set the flush timer based on
  how quickly the data needs to be received. Note that a higher timer value will
  reduce CPU overhead for the trace. Most real-time traces should start with a
  timer of 5 or 10 seconds and tune the timer based on need.
- For buffered (circular in-memory) sessions, **FlushTimer** is not used. The
  trace data will only be flushed on-demand (i.e. flushed to a file via
  [ControlTrace](/windows/win32/api/evntrace/nf-evntrace-controltracea)).

### -field EnableFlags

A _system_ logger session may set **EnableFlags** to indicate which
SystemTraceProvider events should be included in the trace.

> [!Note]
> **EnableFlags** is only valid for system loggers, i.e. trace sessions
> that are started using the `EVENT_TRACE_SYSTEM_LOGGER_MODE` logger mode flag,
> the `KERNEL_LOGGER_NAME` session name, the `SystemTraceControlGuid` session
> GUID, or the `GlobalLoggerGuid` session GUID.

### -field DUMMYUNIONNAME

### -field DUMMYUNIONNAME.AgeLimit

Not used.

**Windows 2000:** Time delay before unused buffers are freed, in minutes. The
default is 15 minutes.

### -field DUMMYUNIONNAME.FlushThreshold

### -field NumberOfBuffers

On output, the number of buffers allocated for the event tracing session's
buffer pool.

### -field FreeBuffers

On output, the number of buffers that are allocated but unused in the event
tracing session's buffer pool.

### -field EventsLost

On output, the number of events that were not recorded.

### -field BuffersWritten

On output, the number of buffers written.

### -field LogBuffersLost

On output, the number of buffers that could not be written to the log file.

### -field RealTimeBuffersLost

On output, the number of buffers that could not be delivered in real-time to the
consumer.

### -field LoggerThreadId

On output, the thread identifier for the event tracing session.

### -field LogFileNameOffset

Offset (in bytes) from the start of this structure's allocated memory to
beginning of the nul-terminated string that contains the log file name.

The file name normally has an `.etl` extension. All folders in the path must
already exist (ETW will not create folders for you). The path can be relative,
absolute, local, or remote. Environment variables in the path will not be
expanded. The user must have permission to write to the folder.

The log file name is limited to 1,024 characters. If you set **LogFileMode** to
**EVENT_TRACE_PRIVATE_LOGGER_MODE** or **EVENT_TRACE_FILE_MODE_NEWFILE**, be
sure to reserve enough memory to include the process identifier that will be
appended to the file name for private loggers sessions and the sequential number
that is added to log files created using the new file log mode.

If you do not want to log events to a log file (for example, if you specify
**EVENT_TRACE_REAL_TIME_MODE** only), set **LogFileNameOffset** to 0. If you
specify only real-time logging and also provide an offset with a valid log file
name, ETW will use the log file name to create a sequential log file and log
events to the log file in addition to sending the events to real-time consumers.
ETW also creates the sequential log file if **LogFileMode** is 0 and you provide
an offset with a valid log file name.

If you want to log events to a log file, you must reserve enough memory for this
structure to include the log file name and session name following the structure.
The log file name must follow the session name in memory. See remarks for an
example.

Trace files are created using the default security descriptor, meaning that the
log file will have the same ACL as the parent directory. If you want access to
the files restricted, create a parent directory with the appropriate ACLs.

### -field LoggerNameOffset

Offset (in bytes) from the start of the structure's allocated memory to the
beginning of the nul-terminated string that contains the session name.

> [!Important]
> Use a descriptive name for your session so that the session's
> ownership and usage can be determined from the session name. Do not use a GUID
> or other non-descriptive value. Do not append random digits to make your
> session name unique. ETW sessions are a limited resource so your component
> should not be starting multiple sessions. If your component's session is
> already running when your component starts, your component should clean up the
> orphaned session rather than creating a second session.

The session name is limited to 1,024 characters. The session name is
case-insensitive. The system will not start a new session if another session
with the same name is already running.

**Windows 2000:** Session names are case-sensitive. As a result, sessions with
names differing only in case are allowed. However, to reduce confusion, you
should make sure your session names are unique.

## -remarks

When you allocate the memory for this structure, you must allocate enough memory
to include the session name and log file name following the structure. The
session name must come before the log file name in memory. You must copy the log
file name to the offset but you do not copy the session name to the offset. The
[StartTrace](/windows/win32/api/evntrace/nf-evntrace-starttracea) function
copies the name for you.

Be sure to initialize the memory for this structure to zero before setting any
members. For example:

```C
typedef struct EventTracePropertyData {
    EVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES Props;
    WCHAR LoggerName[128];
    WCHAR LogFileName[1024];
} EventTracePropertyData;

EventTracePropertyData data = {0};
data.Props.Wnode.BufferSize = sizeof(data);
data.Props.Wnode.Flags = WNODE_FLAG_TRACED_GUID;
data.Props.LogFileNameOffset = offsetof(EventTracePropertyData, LogFileName);
data.Props.LoggerNameOffset = offsetof(EventTracePropertyData, LoggerName);
```

Events from providers are written to a session's buffers. When a buffer in a
file or real-time session is full (or when the FlushTimer expires), the session
flushes the buffer either by writing the events to a log file, delivering them
to a real-time consumer, or both. If a session's buffers are filled faster than
they can be flushed, new buffers are allocated and added to the session's buffer
pool, up to **MaximumBuffers**. Beyond this limit, the session discards incoming
events until a buffer becomes available. Each session keeps a record of the
number of events discarded (see the **EventsLost** member).

To view session statistics, such as **EventsLost** while the session is running,
call the [ControlTrace](/windows/win32/api/evntrace/nf-evntrace-controltracea)
function and set the _ControlCode_ parameter to `EVENT_TRACE_CONTROL_QUERY`.
