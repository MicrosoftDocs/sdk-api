## -description

The <b>DdDestroySurface</b> callback function destroys a DirectDraw surface.

## -parameters

### -param unnamedParam1

Points to a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ddrawint/ns-ddrawint-dd_destroysurfacedata">DD_DESTROYSURFACEDATA</a> structure that contains the information needed to destroy a surface.

## -returns

<b>DdDestroySurface</b> returns one of the following callback codes:

## -remarks

If DirectDraw did the memory allocation at surface creation time and the driver was not involved in the allocation, DirectDraw does not call the driver's <b>DdDestroySurface</b> function to destroy the surface. 

If the driver is performing the surface memory management itself, <b>DdDestroySurface</b> should free the surface memory and perform any other cleanup, such as freeing private data stored in the <b>dwReserved1</b> members of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ddrawint/ns-ddrawint-dd_surface_global">DD_SURFACE_GLOBAL</a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ddrawint/ns-ddrawint-dd_surface_local">DD_SURFACE_LOCAL</a> structures.

For a driver-managed surface, if the surface is persistent (that is, the DDSCAPS2_DONOTPERSIST flag in the <b>dwCaps2</b> member of the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff550292(v=vs.85)">DDSCAPS2</a> structure for the surface is not set), <b>DdDestroySurface</b> can be called with the purpose of envicting the surface from video memory. In this case, the display driver can continue to keep any private data in the <b>dwReserved1</b> members until <b>DdDestroySurface</b> is called to actually destroy the surface.

<b>DdDestroySurface</b> can be called with a disabled <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/">PDEV</a>. PDEV is disabled or enabled by calling the display driver's <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winddi/nf-winddi-drvassertmode">DrvAssertMode</a> function. See <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/display/managing-pdevs">Managing PDEVs</a> for more information.
