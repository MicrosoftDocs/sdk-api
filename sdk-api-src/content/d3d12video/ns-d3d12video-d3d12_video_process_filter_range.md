# D3D12_VIDEO_PROCESS_FILTER_RANGE structure

## -description

Defines the range of supported values for an image filter.

## -struct-fields

### -field Minimum

The minimum value of the filter. 
 
### -field Maximum

The maximum value of the filter. 
 
### -field Default

The default value of the filter. 
 
### -field Multiplier
 
A multiplier. Use the following formula to translate the filter setting into the actual filter value: 

`Actual Value = Set Value × Multiplier.`

## -remarks

The multiplier enables the filter range to have a fractional step value. For example, a hue filter might have an actual range of [–180.0 ... +180.0] with a step size of 0.25. The device would report the following range and multiplier:

- Minimum: –720
- Maximum: +720
- Multiplier: 0.25

In this case, a filter value of 2 would be interpreted by the device as 0.50 (or 2 × 0.25).

The device should use a multiplier that can be represented exactly as a base-2 fraction.
