A pointer to the <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nn-d3d12-id3d12commandallocator">ID3D12CommandAllocator</a> object that the device creates command lists from.

## -returns

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/com/structure-of-com-error-codes">HRESULT</a></b>

<ul>

              </li>
<li><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b> if the operating system ran out of memory.
              </li>
<li><b>E_INVALIDARG</b> if the allocator is currently being used with another command list in the "recording" state or if the specified allocator was created with the wrong type.
              </li>
</ul>
