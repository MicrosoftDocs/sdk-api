## -description

Provides data for calls to [ID3D12VideoDevice::CheckFeatureSupport](nf-d3d12video-id3d12videodevice-checkfeaturesupport.md) when the feature specified is [D3D12_FEATURE_VIDEO_EXTENSION_COMMAND_SIZE](ne-d3d12video-d3d12_feature_video.md). Checks the allocation size of a video extension command.

## -struct-fields

### -field NodeIndex

For single GPU operation, set this to zero. If there are multiple GPU nodes, set a bit to identify the node (the device's physical adapter) to which the command queue applies. Each bit in the mask corresponds to a single node. Only 1 bit may be set.

### -field CommandId

The unique identifier for the video extension command for which size is queried.

### -field pCreationParameters

A pointer to the creation parameters structure, which is defined by the command.  The parameters structure must match the parameters enumerated by a call to [ID3D12VideoDevice::CheckFeatureSupport](nf-d3d12video-id3d12videodevice-checkfeaturesupport.md) with the feature value of [D3D12_FEATURE_VIDEO_EXTENSION_COMMAND_PARAMETERS](ne-d3d12video-d3d12_feature_video.md) and a parameter stage value of [D3D12_VIDEO_EXTENSION_COMMAND_PARAMETER_STAGE_CREATION](ne-d3d12video-d3d12_video_extension_command_parameter_stage.md).

### -field CreationParametersSizeInBytes

The size of the *pCreationParameters* parameter structure, in bytes.

### -field MemoryPoolL0Size

The allocation size of the video extension command in the L0 memory pool. L0 is the physical system memory pool. When the adapter is discrete/NUMA, this pool has greater bandwidth for the CPU and less bandwidth for the GPU. When the adapter is UMA, this pool is the only one which is valid. For more information, see [Residency](/windows/win32/direct3d12/residency).

### -field MemoryPoolL1Size

The allocation size of the video extension command heap in the L1 memory pool. L1 is typically known as the physical video memory pool. L1 is only available when the adapter is discrete/NUMA, and has greater bandwidth for the GPU and cannot even be accessed by the CPU. When the adapter is UMA, this pool is not available. For more information, see [Residency](/windows/win32/direct3d12/residency).
