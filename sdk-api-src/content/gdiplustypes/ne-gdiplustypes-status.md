# Status enumeration


## -description


The <b>Status</b> enumeration indicates the result of a Windows GDI+ method call.


## -enum-fields




### -field Ok

Indicates that the method call was successful. 


### -field GenericError

Indicates that there was an error on the method call, which is identified as something other than those defined by the other elements of this enumeration. 


### -field InvalidParameter

Indicates that one of the arguments passed to the method was not valid. 


### -field OutOfMemory

Indicates that the operating system is out of memory and could not allocate memory to process the method call. For an explanation of how constructors use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/gdiplustypes/ne-gdiplustypes-status">OutOfMemory</a> status, see the Remarks section at the end of this topic. 


### -field ObjectBusy

Indicates that one of the arguments specified in the API call is already in use in another thread. 


### -field InsufficientBuffer

Indicates that a buffer specified as an argument in the API call is not large enough to hold the data to be received. 


### -field NotImplemented

Indicates that the method is not implemented. 


### -field Win32Error

Indicates that the method generated a Win32 error. 


### -field WrongState

Indicates that the object is in an invalid state to satisfy the API call. For example, calling 
				<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/gdipluspen/nf-gdipluspen-pen-getcolor">Pen::GetColor</a> from a pen that is not a single, solid color results in a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/gdiplustypes/ne-gdiplustypes-status">WrongState</a> status. 


### -field Aborted

Indicates that the method was aborted. 


### -field FileNotFound

Indicates that the specified image file or metafile cannot be found. 


### -field ValueOverflow

Indicates that the method performed an arithmetic operation that produced a numeric overflow. 


### -field AccessDenied

Indicates that a write operation is not allowed on the specified file. 


### -field UnknownImageFormat

Indicates that the specified image file format is not known. 


### -field FontFamilyNotFound

Indicates that the specified font family cannot be found. Either the font family name is incorrect or the font family is not installed. 


### -field FontStyleNotFound

Indicates that the specified style is not available for the specified font family. 


### -field NotTrueTypeFont

Indicates that the font retrieved from an 
				<b>HDC</b> or 
				<b>LOGFONT</b> is not a TrueType font and cannot be used with GDI+. 


### -field UnsupportedGdiplusVersion

Indicates that the version of GDI+ that is installed on the system is incompatible with the version with which the application was compiled. 


### -field GdiplusNotInitialized

Indicates that the GDI+API is not in an initialized state. To function, all GDI+ objects require that GDI+ be in an initialized state. Initialize GDI+ by calling 
				<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusinit/nf-gdiplusinit-gdiplusstartup">GdiplusStartup</a>. 


### -field PropertyNotFound

Indicates that the specified property does not exist in the image. 


### -field PropertyNotSupported

Indicates that the specified property is not supported by the format of the image and, therefore, cannot be set. 


### -field ProfileNotFound

Indicates that the color profile required to save an image in CMYK format was not found.


## -remarks



If you construct a GDI+ object and then immediately call the 
				<b>GetLastStatus</b> method of that object, you can determine whether the constructor succeeded or failed. In such cases, 
				<b>GetLastStatus</b> might return <b><b>OutOfMemory</b></b> even though there was plenty of memory available to create the object. Several GDI+ constructors set the status to <b><b>OutOfMemory</b></b> when they fail regardless of the reason for failure.
