## -description

The <b>PeerDistGetOverlappedResult</b> function retrieves the results of asynchronous operations. This function replaces the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-getoverlappedresult">GetOverlappedResult</a> function for Peer Distribution asynchronous operations.

## -parameters

### -param lpOverlapped [in]

A pointer to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-overlapped">OVERLAPPED</a> structure that was specified when the overlapped operation was started.

### -param lpNumberOfBytesTransferred [out]

A pointer to a variable that receives the number of bytes that were actually transferred by a read or write operation. 

### -param bWait [in]

If this parameter is `true`, the function does not return until the operation has been completed. If this parameter is `false` and the operation is still pending, the function returns `false`.

## -returns

Type: **[BOOL](/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types)**

`true` if the operation has completed. `false` if the *bWait* argument is `false` and the operation is still pending.
