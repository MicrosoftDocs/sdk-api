# ITextRange::SetChar


## -description


Sets the character at the starting position of the range.


## -parameters




### -param Char

Type: <b>long</b>

New value for character at the starting position. 


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

The method returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value. If the method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. If the method fails, it returns one of the following error codes.

## -remarks



<b>ITextRange::SetChar</b> lets you specify the precise character code to use. However, string literals with similar looking glyphs can be misleading. 

The characters set by this method are <b>LONG</b> instead of a <b>BSTR</b>. This hides the way that they are stored in the backing store, (as bytes, words, variable-length, and so forth). 

Frequently on systems that do not have automatic word-wrapping, documents have hard carriage returns inserted just for line breaks. The following code shows a simple, but not perfect, way to convert such hard carriage returns back to blanks for the story that is associated with the range r. 




```
    Sub EnableWrap(r As ITextRange)   // Convert false hard CRs to soft
        r.SetRange 0, 0               // r is set at start of story
        While r.Move(tomParagraph)    // Go to start of next paragraph
            If r.MoveWhile(C1_WHITE, 1) = 0 Then    // Next char isn't white space
                r.Move tomCharacter, -1
                r.SetChar = Asc(" ")    // Replace CR by blank
            End If
        Wend        // Loop till no more CRs in story
    End Sub
```


Alternatively, you could use the following inside the IF loop.


```
r.MoveStart tomCharacter, -1        // Select previous char (the CR)
r = " "        // Replace it with a blank
```


This approach enables you to wrap the text to other widths. However, the algorithm isn't perfect: it assumes that a hard carriage return that is followed by anything other than white space (blank, tab, line feed, carriage return, and so forth) should be replaced by a blank. The algorithm also assumes that the carriage return character is a single character like carriage return  or the Unicode end-of-paragraph (EOP) 0x2029 character. And, the combination carriage return and line feed isn't matched and would require writing and executing more code (or use <code>FindText(^p)</code>). Another caution is that there are other cases, such as mixed code and documentation, where the algorithm does not work correctly. 

However, <b>ITextRange::SetChar</b> is more efficient than a replace operation that is accomplished by a delete followed by an insertion. Thus, rewriting the code without using <b>ITextRange::SetChar</b> would probably be much slower. 

The <i>Char</i> property, which can do most things that a characters collection can, has two big advantages: it can reference any character in the parent story instead of being limited to the parent range, and it's significantly faster, since <b>LONG</b>s rather than range objects are involved. Because of these advantages, the Text Object Model (TOM) does not support a characters collection.
