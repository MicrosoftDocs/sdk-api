# ITextSelection interface


## -description

A text selection is a text range with selection highlighting.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">ITextSelection</b> interface inherits from <a href="/windows/desktop/api/tom/nn-tom-itextrange">ITextRange</a>. <b>ITextSelection</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

The selection is associated with some kind of view, and has some UI-oriented methods that allow one to emulate keyboard input. Thus, an application can use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/tom/nn-tom-itextrange">ITextRange</a> methods on a text selection, as well as the <b>ITextSelection</b> methods.

For keyboard input emulation, ranges used in selections use the concept of the <i>active end</i>, which is typically the end that was last moved. For example, if an <b>ITextRange::Move</b>* method operates on a range that is actually a text selection, the most recently moved end is the active one. The most familiar examples of the active end are those involving Shift+Arrow Key handling, where the active end is the one that moves. Accordingly, the <b>ITextSelection</b> methods include move methods for the active end, such as <a href="/windows/desktop/api/tom/nf-tom-itextselection-moveleft">MoveLeft</a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/tom/nf-tom-itextselection-moveright">MoveRight</a>, and methods to get and set the active end status. These methods manipulate selections in ways similar to the standard cursor-keypad operations. This allows you to implement, for example, a macro recorder facility.

To see how the cursor-keypad methods work, see the following table. A given method corresponds to a cursor-keypad key with the Ctrl and Shift keys. The <i>Unit</i> parameter is selected by pressing or not pressing the Ctrl key, while the <i>Extend</i> parameter is selected by pressing or not pressing the Shift key. Note, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/tom/nf-tom-itextselection-moveup">MoveUp</a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/tom/nf-tom-itextselection-movedown">MoveDown</a> correspond to more than one keypad key. For more information, see the descriptions of the methods.

Applications typically do not implement the <b>ITextSelection</b> interface. Instead, Microsoft text solutions such as rich edit controls implement <b>ITextSelection</b> as part of their Text Object Model (TOM) implementation.

Applications can retrieve an <b>ITextSelection</b> pointer by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/tom/nf-tom-itextdocument-getselection">GetSelection</a> method.
