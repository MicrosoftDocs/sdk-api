# WTS_PROTOCOL_COUNTERS structure


## -description


Contains protocol performance counters.


## -struct-fields




### -field WdBytes

The number of bytes sent and received.


### -field WdFrames

The number of frames sent and received.


### -field WaitForOutBuf

The number of times the protocol waited for an output buffer to become available.


### -field Frames

Transport driver number of frames sent and received.


### -field Bytes

Transport driver number of bytes sent and received.


### -field CompressedBytes

The number of compressed bytes.


### -field CompressFlushes

The number of compressed flushes. A compressed flush occurs when compression for a packet fails and is replaced by the original uncompressed packet.


### -field Errors

The number of packets that were in error during the session.


### -field Timeouts

The number of timeouts during the session.


### -field AsyncFramingError

The number of asynchronous framing errors during the session.


### -field AsyncOverrunError

The number of asynchronous overrun errors during the session.


### -field AsyncOverflowError

The number of asynchronous overflow errors during the session.


### -field AsyncParityError

The number of asynchronous parity errors during the session.


### -field TdErrors

The number of transport protocol errors during the session.


### -field ProtocolType

The type of the protocol.


### -field Length

The length of data in the <b>Reserved</b> field.


### -field Specific

Specifies the type of counter that can be queried. This can be <b>TShareCounters</b> or <b>Reserved</b>.


### -field Reserved

An array of protocol specific data. The maximum length can be WTS_MAX_RESERVED multiplied by the size of an unsigned long integer.


## -remarks
