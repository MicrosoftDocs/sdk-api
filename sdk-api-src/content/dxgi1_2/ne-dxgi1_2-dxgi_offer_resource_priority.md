# DXGI_OFFER_RESOURCE_PRIORITY enumeration


## -description


Identifies the importance of a resource’s content when you call the  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dxgi1_2/nf-dxgi1_2-idxgidevice2-offerresources">IDXGIDevice2::OfferResources</a> method to offer the resource.
        


## -enum-fields




### -field DXGI_OFFER_RESOURCE_PRIORITY_LOW

The resource is low priority. The operating system discards a low priority resource before other offered resources with higher priority. It is a good programming practice to mark a resource as low priority if it has no useful content.


### -field DXGI_OFFER_RESOURCE_PRIORITY_NORMAL

The resource is normal priority. You mark a resource as normal priority if it has  content that is easy to regenerate.


### -field DXGI_OFFER_RESOURCE_PRIORITY_HIGH

The resource is high priority. The operating system discards other offered resources with lower priority before it discards a high priority resource.  You mark a resource as high priority if it has useful content that is difficult to regenerate.


## -remarks



Priority determines how likely the operating system is to discard an offered resource.  Resources offered with lower priority are discarded first.
