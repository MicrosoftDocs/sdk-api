# DXGI_COMPUTE_PREEMPTION_GRANULARITY enumeration


## -description


Identifies the granularity at which the graphics processing unit (GPU) can be preempted from performing its current compute task.


## -enum-fields




### -field DXGI_COMPUTE_PREEMPTION_DMA_BUFFER_BOUNDARY

Indicates the preemption granularity as a compute packet.


### -field DXGI_COMPUTE_PREEMPTION_DISPATCH_BOUNDARY

Indicates the preemption granularity as a dispatch (for example, a call to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d11/nf-d3d11-id3d11devicecontext-dispatch">ID3D11DeviceContext::Dispatch</a> method). A dispatch is a part of a compute packet.


### -field DXGI_COMPUTE_PREEMPTION_THREAD_GROUP_BOUNDARY

Indicates the preemption granularity as a thread group. A thread group is a part of a dispatch.


### -field DXGI_COMPUTE_PREEMPTION_THREAD_BOUNDARY

Indicates the preemption granularity as a thread in a thread group. A thread is a part of a thread group.


### -field DXGI_COMPUTE_PREEMPTION_INSTRUCTION_BOUNDARY

Indicates the preemption granularity as a compute instruction in a thread.


## -remarks



You call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dxgi1_2/nf-dxgi1_2-idxgiadapter2-getdesc2">IDXGIAdapter2::GetDesc2</a> method to retrieve the granularity level at which the GPU can be preempted from performing its current compute task. The operating system specifies the compute granularity level in the  <b>ComputePreemptionGranularity</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dxgi1_2/ns-dxgi1_2-dxgi_adapter_desc2">DXGI_ADAPTER_DESC2</a> structure.
