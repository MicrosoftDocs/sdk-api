# DXGI_ADAPTER_DESC2 structure


## -description

Describes an adapter (or video card) that uses Microsoft DirectX Graphics Infrastructure (DXGI) 1.2.

## -struct-fields

### -field Description

A string that contains the adapter description.

### -field VendorId

The PCI ID of the hardware vendor.

### -field DeviceId

The PCI ID of the hardware device.

### -field SubSysId

The PCI ID of the sub system.

### -field Revision

The PCI ID of the revision number of the adapter.

### -field DedicatedVideoMemory

The number of bytes of dedicated video memory that are not shared with the CPU.

### -field DedicatedSystemMemory

The number of bytes of dedicated system memory that are not shared with the CPU. This memory is allocated from available system memory at boot time.

### -field SharedSystemMemory

The number of bytes of shared system memory. This is the maximum value of system memory that may be consumed by the adapter during operation. Any incidental memory consumed by the driver as it manages and uses video memory is additional.

### -field AdapterLuid

A unique value that identifies the adapter. See <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff549708(v=vs.85)">LUID</a> for a definition of the structure. <b>LUID</b> is defined in dxgi.h.

### -field Flags

A value of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/dxgi/ne-dxgi-dxgi_adapter_flag">DXGI_ADAPTER_FLAG</a> enumerated type that describes the adapter type.  The <b>DXGI_ADAPTER_FLAG_REMOTE</b> flag is reserved.

### -field GraphicsPreemptionGranularity

A value of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/dxgi1_2/ne-dxgi1_2-dxgi_graphics_preemption_granularity">DXGI_GRAPHICS_PREEMPTION_GRANULARITY</a> enumerated type that describes the granularity level at which the GPU can be preempted from performing its current graphics rendering task.

### -field ComputePreemptionGranularity

A value of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/dxgi1_2/ne-dxgi1_2-dxgi_compute_preemption_granularity">DXGI_COMPUTE_PREEMPTION_GRANULARITY</a> enumerated type that describes the granularity level at which the GPU can be preempted from performing its current compute task.

## -remarks

The <b>DXGI_ADAPTER_DESC2</b> structure provides a DXGI 1.2 description of an adapter.  This structure is initialized by using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/dxgi1_2/nf-dxgi1_2-idxgiadapter2-getdesc2">IDXGIAdapter2::GetDesc2</a> method.
