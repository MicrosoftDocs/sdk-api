The <b>DS_NAME_ERROR</b> enumeration defines the errors returned by the <b>status</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ntdsapi/ns-ntdsapi-ds_name_result_itema">DS_NAME_RESULT_ITEM</a> structure. These are potential errors that may be encountered while a name is converted by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ntdsapi/nf-ntdsapi-dscracknamesa">DsCrackNames</a> function.
