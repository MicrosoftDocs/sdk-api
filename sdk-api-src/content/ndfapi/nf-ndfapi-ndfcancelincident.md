# NdfCancelIncident function


## -description


The <b>NdfCancelIncident</b> function is used to cancel unneeded functions which have been previously called on an existing incident.


## -parameters




### -param Handle [in]

Type: <b>NDFHANDLE</b>

Handle to the Network Diagnostics Framework incident. This handle should match the handle of an existing incident.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

Possible return values include, but are not limited to, the following.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The operation succeeded.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

 Any result other than S_OK should be interpreted as an error.




## -remarks



Before using this API, an application must call an incident creation function such as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ndfapi/nf-ndfapi-ndfcreatewebincident">NdfCreateWebIncident</a>.

<b>NdfCancelIncident</b> is primarily used to cancel calls to functions such as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ndfapi/nf-ndfapi-ndfdiagnoseincident">NdfDiagnoseIncident</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ndfapi/nf-ndfapi-ndfrepairincident">NdfRepairIncident</a> which have been previously called, but are no longer needed. When <b>NdfCancelIncident</b> is called, NDF will stop the diagnosis/repair as soon as possible rather than calling the other functions (unless results have already been returned from those functions, in which case <b>NdfCancelIncident</b> will have no effect).


<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ndfapi/nf-ndfapi-ndfcloseincident">NdfCloseIncident</a> should be used to close an incident once it has been resolved, as <b>NdfCancelIncident</b> does not actually close the incident itself.
