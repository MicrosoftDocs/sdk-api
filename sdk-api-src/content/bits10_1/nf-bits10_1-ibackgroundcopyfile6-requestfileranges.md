# IBackgroundCopyFile6::RequestFileRanges


## -description


Adds a new set of file ranges to be prioritized for download. 


## -parameters




### -param rangeCount [in]

Specifies the size of the <i>Ranges</i> array.


### -param ranges [in]

An array of file ranges to be downloaded. Requested ranges are allowed to overlap previously downloaded (or pending) ranges. Ranges are automatically split into non-overlapping ranges. 


## -returns



If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.  <b>BG_E_INVALID_RANGE</b> is returned if any part of the requested range is outside the actual file size; <b>BG_E_RANDOM_ACCESS_NOT_SUPPORTED</b> is returned if the job is not a download job or if the server loses its ability to support download ranges.




## -remarks



<b>RequestFileRanges</b> can be requested for any download job that also meets the requirements for <b>BITS_JOB_PROPERTY_ON_DEMAND_MODE</b> jobs.

  
The requirements for a <b>BITS_JOB_PROPERTY_ON_DEMAND_MODE</b> job is that the transfer must be a <b>DOWNLOAD</b> job.  The job must not be <b>DYNAMIC</b> and the server must be an HTTP or HTTPS server and the server requirements for range support must all be met.
For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Bits/http-requirements-for-bits-downloads">HTTP Requirements for BITS Downloads</a>.

When all of the requested ranges have been downloaded the job state will be set to <b>BG_JOB_STATE_TRANSFERRED</b> if all of the bytes of the file have been transferred.  Otherwise, the job state will be set to <b>BG_JOB_STATE_SUSPENDED</b>.
