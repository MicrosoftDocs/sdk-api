# IXpsOMPrintTicketResource::GetStream


## -description

Gets a new, read-only copy of the stream that is associated with this resource.

## -parameters

### -param stream [out, retval]

A new, read-only copy of the stream that is associated with this resource.

## -returns

If the method succeeds, it returns S_OK; otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code. For information about  XPS document API return values, see <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/dd372955(v=vs.85)">XPS Document Errors</a>.

This method calls the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/opc/packaging">Packaging</a> API. For information about the Packaging API return values, see <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/opc/packaging-errors">Packaging Errors</a>.

## -remarks

The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-istream">IStream</a> object returned by this method might return an error of E_PENDING, which indicates that the stream length has not been determined yet.  This behavior is different from that of a standard <b>IStream</b> object.

This method calls the stream's <b>Clone</b> method to create the stream returned in <i>stream</i>. As a result, the performance of this method will depend on that of the stream's <b>Clone</b> method.
