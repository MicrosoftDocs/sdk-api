## -remarks

To examine the XPS markup of a page before it is written to an XPS package, an application can call the <b>Write</b> method to write the page's contents to a stream. The application can then read that stream to examine the XPS markup as it would be serialized when it is written to the XPS package.

The XPS markup that is  written to the stream by this method contains the page markup but none of the page's resources.
