# MAPIDETAILS callback function


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[The use of this function is discouraged. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.]

The <b>MAPIDetails</b> function displays a dialog box containing the details of a selected address list entry.


## -parameters




### -param lhSession [in]

Session handle that represents a Simple MAPI session or zero. If the value of the <i>lhSession</i> parameter is zero, MAPI logs on the user and creates a session that exists only for the duration of the call. This temporary session can be an existing shared session or a new one. If additional information is required from the user to successfully complete the logon, a dialog box is displayed.


### -param ulUIParam [in]

Parent window handle or zero, indicating that if a dialog box is displayed, it is application modal. If the <i>ulUIParam</i> parameter contains a parent window handle, it is of type HWND (cast to a ULONG_PTR). If no dialog box is displayed during the call, <i> ulUIParam</i> is ignored.


### -param lpRecip [in]

Pointer to the recipient for which details are to be displayed.  <b>MAPIDetails</b> ignores all members of this <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mapi/ns-mapi-mapirecipdesc">MapiRecipDesc</a> structure except the <b>ulEIDSize</b> and <b>lpEntryID</b> members. If the value of <b>ulEIDSize</b> is nonzero, <b>MAPIDetails</b> resolves the recipient entry. If the value of <b>ulEIDSize</b> is zero, <b>MAPIDetails</b> returns the MAPI_E_AMBIGUOUS_RECIP value. 


### -param flFlags [in]

Bitmask of option flags. The following flags can be set.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="MAPI_AB_NOMODIFY_"></a><a id="mapi_ab_nomodify_"></a><dl>
<dt><b>MAPI_AB_NOMODIFY </b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The caller is requesting that the dialog box be read-only, prohibiting changes. <b>MAPIDetails</b> might or might not honor the request.

</td>
</tr>

<dt><b>MAPI_LOGON_UI </b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
A dialog box should be displayed to prompt the user to log on if required. When the MAPI_LOGON_UI flag is not set, the client application does not display a logon dialog box and returns an error value if the user is not logged on.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="MAPI_NEW_SESSION_"></a><a id="mapi_new_session_"></a><dl>
<dt><b>MAPI_NEW_SESSION </b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
An attempt should be made to create a new session rather than acquire the environment's shared session. If the MAPI_NEW_SESSION flag is not set, <b>MAPIDetails</b> uses an existing shared session.

## -remarks



The <b>MAPIDetails</b> function presents a dialog box that shows the details of a particular address list entry. The display name and address are the minimum attributes that are displayed in the dialog box; more information can be shown, depending on the address book provider. The details dialog box cannot be suppressed, but the caller can request that it be read-only or modifiable. 

Details can only be shown for resolved address list entries. An entry is resolved if the value of the <b>ulEIDSize</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mapi/ns-mapi-mapirecipdesc">MapiRecipDesc</a> structure is nonzero. Entries are resolved when they are returned by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mapi/nc-mapi-mapiaddress">MAPIAddress</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mapi/nc-mapi-mapiresolvename">MAPIResolveName</a> functions and as the result being recipients of read mail.
