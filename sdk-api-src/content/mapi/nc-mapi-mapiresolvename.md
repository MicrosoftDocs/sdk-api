# MAPIRESOLVENAME callback function


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[The use of this function is discouraged. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.]

The <b>MAPIResolveName</b> function transforms a message recipient's name as entered by a user to an unambiguous address list entry.


## -parameters




### -param lhSession [in]

Handle that represents a Simple MAPI session or zero. If the value of the <i>lhSession</i> parameter is zero, MAPI logs on the user and creates a session that exists only for the duration of the call. This temporary session can be an existing shared session or a new one. If necessary, the logon dialog box is displayed.


### -param ulUIParam [in]

Parent window handle or zero, indicating that if a dialog box is displayed, it is application modal. If the <i>ulUIParam</i> parameter contains a parent window handle, it is of type <b>HWND</b> (cast to a <b>ULONG_PTR</b>). If no dialog box is displayed during the call, <i> ulUIParam</i> is ignored.


### -param lpszName [in]

Pointer to the name to be resolved.


### -param flFlags [in]

Bitmask of option flags. The following flags can be set.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="MAPI_AB_NOMODIFY_"></a><a id="mapi_ab_nomodify_"></a><dl>
<dt><b>MAPI_AB_NOMODIFY </b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The caller is requesting that the dialog box be read-only, prohibiting changes. <b>MAPIResolveName</b> ignores this flag if MAPI_DIALOG is not set. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="MAPI_DIALOG_"></a><a id="mapi_dialog_"></a><dl>
<dt><b>MAPI_DIALOG </b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
A dialog box should be displayed for name resolution. If this flag is not set and the name cannot be resolved, <b>MAPIResolveName</b> returns the MAPI_E_AMBIGUOUS_RECIPIENT value.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="MAPI_LOGON_UI_"></a><a id="mapi_logon_ui_"></a><dl>
<dt><b>MAPI_LOGON_UI </b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
A dialog box should be displayed to prompt the user to log on if required. When the MAPI_LOGON_UI flag is not set, the client application does not display a logon dialog box and returns an error value if the user is not logged on.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="MAPI_NEW_SESSION_"></a><a id="mapi_new_session_"></a><dl>
<dt><b>MAPI_NEW_SESSION </b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
An attempt should be made to create a new session rather than acquire the environment's shared session. If the MAPI_NEW_SESSION flag is not set, <b>MAPIResolveName</b> uses an existing shared session.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -param ulReserved

Reserved; must be zero.


### -param *lppRecip [out]

Pointer to a recipient structure if the resolution results in a single match. The recipient structure contains the resolved name and related information. Memory for this structure must be freed using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mapi/nf-mapi-mapifreebuffer">MAPIFreeBuffer</a> function.

## -remarks



The <b>MAPIResolveName</b> function resolves a message recipient's name (as entered by a user) to an unambiguous address list entry, optionally prompting the user to choose between possible entries, if necessary. A recipient descriptor structure containing fully resolved information about the entry is allocated and returned. The caller should free this <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mapi/ns-mapi-mapirecipdesc">MapiRecipDesc</a> structure at some point by calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mapi/nf-mapi-mapifreebuffer">MAPIFreeBuffer</a> function. If <b>MAPIResolveName</b> returns an error value, it is not necessary to deallocate memory with <b>MAPIFreeBuffer</b>.
