# CustomLineCap class


## -description


The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms536216(v=VS.85).aspx">CustomLineCap</a> class encapsulates a custom line cap. A line cap defines the style of graphic used to draw the ends of a line. It can be various shapes, such as a square, circle, or diamond. A custom line cap is defined by the path that draws it. The path is drawn by using a 
			<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms534485(v=VS.85).aspx">Pen</a>
 object to draw the outline of a shape or by using a 
			<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms534424(v=VS.85).aspx">Brush</a>
 object to fill the interior. The cap can be used on either or both ends of the line. Spacing can be adjusted between the end caps and the line.
