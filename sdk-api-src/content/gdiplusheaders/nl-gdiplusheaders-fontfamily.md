# FontFamily class


## -description


This <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusheaders/nf-gdiplusheaders-fontfamily-fontfamily(constfontfamily_)">FontFamily</a> class encapsulates a set of fonts that make up a font family. A font family is a group of fonts that have the same typeface but different styles.


## -remarks



Only regular, bold, italic, and bold italic are abstracted into the family, other styles, such as Narrow or Black, are considered separate font families. For example Times New Roman is a font family. The Times New Roman font family includes regular, bold, italic, and bold italic.
