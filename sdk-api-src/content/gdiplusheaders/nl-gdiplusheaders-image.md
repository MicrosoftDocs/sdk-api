The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusheaders/nf-gdiplusheaders-image-image(gpimage_status)">Image</a> class provides methods for loading and saving raster images (bitmaps) and vector images (metafiles). An Image object encapsulates a bitmap or a metafile and stores attributes that you can retrieve by calling various Get methods. You can construct Image objects from a variety of file types including BMP, ICON, GIF, JPEG, Exif, PNG, TIFF, WMF, and EMF.
