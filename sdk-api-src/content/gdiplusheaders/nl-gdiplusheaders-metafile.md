# Metafile class


## -description


The <b>Metafile</b> class defines a graphic metafile. A metafile contains records that describe a sequence of graphics API calls. Metafiles can be recorded (constructed) and played back (displayed).


## -remarks



Some <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a9648287-65d9-47d8-b32b-33f74b4fcd07">Metafile</a> constructors (those that receive a device context handle) create <b>Metafile</b> objects that are used to record metafiles. Other Metafile constructors (those that do not receive a device context handle) create <b>Metafile</b> objects that are used to display (play back) metafiles.
