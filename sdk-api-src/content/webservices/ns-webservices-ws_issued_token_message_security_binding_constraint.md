# WS_ISSUED_TOKEN_MESSAGE_SECURITY_BINDING_CONSTRAINT structure


## -description


A security binding constraint that can be used to extract information
                about how to obtain an issued token from an issuing party.
            


## -struct-fields




### -field bindingConstraint

The base binding constraint that this binding constraint derives from.
                

There are currently no binding-specific properties defined for this binding constraint.
                


### -field bindingUsage

This specifies how the issued token should be attached to a message.
                


### -field claimConstraints

This field contains a list of claim types that 
                    are allowed in the policy.  Each claim type is 
                    a URI which identifies the type of claim.
                


### -field claimConstraintCount

The number of elements in the claimConstraints array.
                

If this value is 0, then the claimConstraints array may be
                    <b>NULL</b>, and any claims are allowed to appear in the policy.
                


### -field requestSecurityTokenPropertyConstraints

A set of property constraints relating to how to request a security token.
                

See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/webservices/ns-webservices-ws_request_security_token_property_constraint">WS_REQUEST_SECURITY_TOKEN_PROPERTY_CONSTRAINT</a> for more information.
                


### -field requestSecurityTokenPropertyConstraintCount

The number of elements in the requestSecurityTokenPropertyConstraints array.
                

If the array has zero elements, the requestSecurityTokenPropertyConstraints field may be <b>NULL</b>.
                


### -field out

When <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/webservices/nf-webservices-wsmatchpolicyalternative">WsMatchPolicyAlternative</a> returns NOERROR, the
                    entire contents of this structure will be filled out.
                


### -field out.issuerAddress

 


### -field out.requestSecurityTokenTemplate

 




## -remarks



The information extracted using this binding constraint can be used
                with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/webservices/nf-webservices-wsrequestsecuritytoken">WsRequestSecurityToken</a> to obtain an issued token.
                The issued token can then be used with the 
                <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/webservices/ns-webservices-ws_xml_token_message_security_binding">WS_XML_TOKEN_MESSAGE_SECURITY_BINDING</a> security binding.
            

This binding constraint is typically used in federated security
                scenarios.
