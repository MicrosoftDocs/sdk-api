# WS_SECURITY_CONTEXT_MESSAGE_SECURITY_BINDING_CONSTRAINT structure


## -description

A security binding constraint that corresponds to 
        the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/webservices/ns-webservices-ws_security_context_message_security_binding">WS_SECURITY_CONTEXT_MESSAGE_SECURITY_BINDING</a>.

## -struct-fields

### -field bindingConstraint

The base binding constraint that this binding constraint derives from.
        

The following binding constraints are supported at this point: <a href="/windows/desktop/api/webservices/ne-webservices-ws_security_binding_property_id">WS_SECURITY_BINDING_PROPERTY_SECURE_CONVERSATION_VERSION</a> 
          and <b>WS_SECURITY_BINDING_PROPERTY_SECURITY_CONTEXT_KEY_ENTROPY_MODE</b>. 
           Currently only <a href="/windows/desktop/api/webservices/ne-webservices-ws_secure_conversation_version">WS_SECURE_CONVERSATION_VERSION_FEBRUARY_2005</a>is supported in policy, so a binding constraint containing the
          value <b>WS_SECURE_CONVERSATION_VERSION_FEBRUARY_2005</b> must be specified in
          order for the policy to match.

### -field bindingUsage

This specifies how the security context token should be attached to a message.

### -field bootstrapSecurityConstraint

This specifies the bootstrap security used to establish the secure conversation context.
