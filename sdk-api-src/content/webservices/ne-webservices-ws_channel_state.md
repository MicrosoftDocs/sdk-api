:::image type="content" source="./images/ChannelStates.png" border="false" alt-text="Diagram of the state transitions for a Channel object. A second diagram shows the Sub-states for the Channel's Open state.":::

A channel may move to the <b>WS_CHANNEL_STATE_FAULTED</b> 
                state even if <a href="/windows/desktop/api/webservices/nf-webservices-wsabortchannel">WsAbortChannel</a> was never called.
                This will only occur if the channel can no longer be used.
            

Note that only the valid state transitions are shown.  Using
                a function not shown for a given state will result in an
                <b>WS_E_INVALID_OPERATION</b> error being returned from
                the function (or crash in the case of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/webservices/nf-webservices-wsfreechannel">WsFreeChannel</a>).
            For information on error codes, see<a href="/windows/desktop/wsw/windows-web-services-return-values">Windows Web Services Return Values</a>.
