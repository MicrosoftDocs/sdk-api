# WS_MESSAGE_STATE enumeration


## -description

The different states that a message can be in.

## -enum-fields

### -field WS_MESSAGE_STATE_EMPTY

The initial state after a message has been created.
                    In this state, there is no content in the message, and
                    neither the header nor the body can be accessed.

### -field WS_MESSAGE_STATE_INITIALIZED

The message headers have been initialized, and
                    can be accessed, but the body cannot be accessed.  This state
                    is used to build up all the headers prior to writing/sending them.

### -field WS_MESSAGE_STATE_READING

The body of the message is being read, for example
                    when a message is received.
                    In this state, the headers can be accessed, and the body can
                    be read (see <a href="/windows/desktop/api/webservices/nf-webservices-wsreadbody">WsReadBody</a> or
                    <a href="/windows/desktop/api/webservices/ne-webservices-ws_message_property_id">WS_MESSAGE_PROPERTY_BODY_READER</a>).

### -field WS_MESSAGE_STATE_WRITING

The body of the message is being written, for example
                    when a message is being sent.
                    In this state, the headers can be accessed, and the body can
                    be written (see <a href="/windows/desktop/api/webservices/nf-webservices-wswritebody">WsWriteBody</a> or
                    <a href="/windows/desktop/api/webservices/ne-webservices-ws_message_property_id">WS_MESSAGE_PROPERTY_BODY_WRITER</a>).

### -field WS_MESSAGE_STATE_DONE

The message body has been read or written (the end of the
                    body has been read or written).  The headers can still be accessed.

## -remarks

A message object transitions through a set of states as it
                is being received or sent (or read or written).
            

The following are the state transitions while writing or sending:

                shown.
