# WS_UNIQUE_ID structure


## -description


Represents a unique ID URI.
            


## -struct-fields




### -field uri

A string representation of the URI.  If length is zero,
                    then the unique ID is a guid, and the value is stored
                    in the guid field.  Otherwise, the URI is a string
                    and the string value is stored in the uri field.
                


### -field guid

If the uri.length field is 0, then this field contains
                    the GUID representation of the unique ID.  Otherwise
                    the value of the field is not defined.
                


## -remarks



This structure represents a URI that is used as a unique ID.
                It has native support for GUID-based URI's, but can also
                accommodate other unique-id URI's as a string.
