                The <b>Channel</b> must be in the either the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/webservices/ne-webservices-ws_channel_state">WS_CHANNEL_STATE_CREATED</a> 
                or <b>WS_CHANNEL_STATE_CLOSED</b> state to be released.
            If a Channel has been successfully opened it must be closed before it
                can be released.

## -parameters

A pointer to the <b>Channel</b> object to release. The pointer must reference a valid <a href="/windows/desktop/wsw/ws-channel">WS_CHANNEL</a> object returned
                    by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/webservices/nf-webservices-wscreatechannel">WsCreateChannel</a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/webservices/nf-webservices-wscreatechannelforlistener">WsCreateChannelForListener</a>.
                    The referenced value may not be <b>NULL</b>.

## -remarks

                released until the accept/open completes.  Use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/webservices/nf-webservices-wsabortchannel">WsAbortChannel</a> to cancel the accept/open process.
