# WsReadChars function


## -description


Reads a specified number of text characters from the Reader.
      


## -parameters




### -param reader [in]

A pointer to the <b>XML Reader</b> from which the character data should be read.  The pointer must reference a valid <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/wsw/ws-xml-reader">WS_XML_READER</a> object.
        


### -param chars

A pointer to a location for  the characters that have been read.


### -param maxCharCount [in]

The maximum number of characters that should be read.


### -param actualCharCount [out]

A pointer to a ULONG value of 
          the actual number of characters that were read.  This may be less than maxCharCount even when there
          are more characters remaining.  There are no more characters when this returns zero.
        


### -param error [in, optional]

A  pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/wsw/ws-error">WS_ERROR</a> object where additional information about the error should be stored if the function fails.
                


## -returns



This function can return one of these values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>WS_E_INVALID_FORMAT</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The input data was not in the expected format or did not have the expected value.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>WS_E_QUOTA_EXCEEDED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
A quota was exceeded.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



Text is read up to either a start element or end element.  Comments are skipped, and CDATA content is treated
        identically to element content.  Character entities are converted to their unescaped form.
      

This function can fail for any of the reasons listed in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/webservices/nf-webservices-wsreadnode">WsReadNode</a>.
