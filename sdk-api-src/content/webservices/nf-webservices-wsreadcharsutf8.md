# WsReadCharsUtf8 function


## -description


Reads a specified number of text characters from the reader and returns them encoded in UTF-8.
      


## -parameters




### -param reader [in]

A pointer to the <b>XML Reader</b> from which the character data should be read.  The pointer must reference a valid <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/wsw/ws-xml-reader">WS_XML_READER</a> object.
        


### -param bytes

A pointer to the buffer to place the encoded bytes that have been read.


### -param maxByteCount [in]

The maximum number of bytes that should be read.


### -param actualByteCount [out]

A pointer to a ULONG value of 
          the actual number of bytes that were read.  This may be less than maxByteCount even when there
          are more bytes remaining.  There are no more bytes when this returns zero.
        


### -param error [in, optional]

A  pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/wsw/ws-error">WS_ERROR</a> object where additional information about the error should be stored if the function fails.
                


## -returns

## -remarks



XML text is read up to either a start element or end element.  Comments are skipped, and CDATA content is treated
        identically to element content.    Character entities are converted to their unescaped form.
      

This function can fail for any of the reasons listed in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/webservices/nf-webservices-wsreadnode">WsReadNode</a>.
