# WS_SECURITY_BINDING structure


## -description


The abstract base type for all security bindings.  One or more
concrete subtypes of this are specified in the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/webservices/ns-webservices-ws_security_description">security description</a> that is
supplied during channel and listener creation.  Each concrete subtype
of this corresponds to a security protocol and a way of using it to
provide authentication and/or protection to a channel.
            

Each security binding subtype instance in the security description
contributes one security token at runtime.  Thus, the fields of this
type can be viewed as specifying a security token, how to obtain it,
how to use it for channel security, and how to modify its behavior
using the optional settings.
            


## -struct-fields




### -field bindingType

The<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/webservices/ne-webservices-ws_security_binding_type"> WS_SECURITY_BINDING_TYPE</a> of the security binding being described.  The type value
indicates how to obtain the security token corresponding to this
security binding.
                


### -field properties

The array of properties specifying the optional security binding
settings.  Each <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/webservices/ns-webservices-ws_security_binding_property">WS_SECURITY_BINDING_PROPERTY</a> in the array is a key-value
pair and must use a key defined in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/webservices/ne-webservices-ws_security_binding_property_id">WS_SECURITY_BINDING_PROPERTY_ID</a>.  This field can be <b>NULL</b>, and if
it is <b>NULL</b>, the default value will be used for each security token
setting.
                


### -field propertyCount

The count of elements in the properties array.
