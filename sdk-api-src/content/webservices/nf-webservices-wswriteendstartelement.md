## -remarks



Occasionally, it is useful to explicitly force the completion of an element.  This can be used to force the writer
        to write a full element and pair.  It also may be useful when obtaining positions when writing to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/wsw/ws-xml-buffer">WS_XML_BUFFER</a>.
      

Calling this API when there is no element to commit will cause it to return <b>WS_E_INVALID_OPERATION</b>.
      (See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/wsw/windows-web-services-return-values">Windows Web Services Return Values</a>.)
