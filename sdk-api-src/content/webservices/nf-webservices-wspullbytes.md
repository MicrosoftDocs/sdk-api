## -parameters




### -param writer [in]

The writer to which the bytes will be written.
        


### -param callback [in]

The callback to invoke when its time to write the binary data.
        


### -param callbackState [in, optional]

User-defined state to be passed to the callback.
        


### -param error [in, optional]

Specifies where additional error information should be stored if the function fails.

## -remarks




<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/webservices/nf-webservices-wswritebytes">WsWriteBytes</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/webservices/nf-webservices-wspushbytes">WsPushBytes</a> require the buffer of data to be provided to the writer.
        In some usage patterns, this may require an extra copy of the data.  For those scenarios, <b>WsPullBytes</b>offers a way to request the writer to provide the buffer that must be filled with data.
      

If the encoding cannot take advantage of this behavior, then <b>WsPullBytes</b> will invoke the
        callback immediately and operate as if <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/webservices/nf-webservices-wswritebytes">WsWriteBytes</a> was called on the resulting data.
