# WS_ADDRESSING_VERSION enumeration


## -description

Identifies the version of the specification used for
                the addressing headers.

## -enum-fields

### -field WS_ADDRESSING_VERSION_0_9

The message addressing headers correspond to version 0.9 (August 2004)
                    of the addressing specification <a href="https://www.w3.org/Submission/ws-addressing/">Web Services Addressing (WS-Addressing)</a>.

### -field WS_ADDRESSING_VERSION_1_0

The message addressing headers correspond to version 1.0 (May 2006)
                    of the addressing specification <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ws-addr-core/">Web Services Addressing 1.0 - Core</a>.

### -field WS_ADDRESSING_VERSION_TRANSPORT

This addressing version indicates that the only addressing headers
                    supported are those that are natively supported by the underlying
                    transport (there are no addressing-related headers that are transmitted
                    as part of the SOAP envelope).
                

The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/webservices/ne-webservices-ws_header_type">WS_ACTION_HEADER</a> and <b>WS_TO_HEADER</b> are
                    automatically mapped to/from the transport-specific message locations
                    when messages are sent/received.  Use of other <b>WS_HEADER_TYPE</b>are not supported for this addressing version.
                

This addressing version is only supported for <a href="/windows/desktop/api/webservices/ne-webservices-ws_channel_binding">WS_HTTP_CHANNEL_BINDING</a>.
                    Since the SOAP over HTTP protocol does not support sending an action on a reply,
                    the value of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/webservices/ne-webservices-ws_header_type">WS_ACTION_HEADER</a> will not be transmitted by the channel.
