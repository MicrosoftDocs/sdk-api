# WS_SECURITY_TIMESTAMP_USAGE enumeration


## -description


With message security and mixed-mode security, this defines when a
timestamp element should be generated and demanded in the WS-Security
header.
            


## -enum-fields




### -field WS_SECURITY_TIMESTAMP_USAGE_ALWAYS

Always generate a timestamp in each outgoing message and demand a
timestamp be present in each incoming message, whether those messages
are requests or replies.
                


### -field WS_SECURITY_TIMESTAMP_USAGE_NEVER

Do not use timestamps in requests or replies.  It is an error to
specify this value when a mixed-mode message signature is required in
the WS-Security header.
                


### -field WS_SECURITY_TIMESTAMP_USAGE_REQUESTS_ONLY

Generate and demand timestamps in client to server request messages,
but not in server to client reply messages.  This value may be used in
mixed-mode security.
