# WS_USERNAME_MESSAGE_SECURITY_BINDING_TEMPLATE structure


## -description


The security binding template for specifying the use of an application
        supplied username / password pair as a direct (i.e., one-shot)
        security token.  This security binding may be used only with message
        security.  It provides client authentication, but not traffic signing
        or encryption.  So, it is used in conjunction with another transport
        security or message security binding that provides message protection.
