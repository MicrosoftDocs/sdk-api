# WsPushBytes function


## -description


Establishes a callback to be invoked to write bytes within an element.  In some encodings this can
        be more efficient by eliminating a copy of the data.
      


## -parameters




### -param writer [in]

A pointer to the XML Writer object to which the bytes are written.  The pointer must reference a valid <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/wsw/ws-xml-writer">WS_XML_WRITER</a> and   the referenced value may not be <b>NULL</b>.
                


### -param callback [in]

This parameter is the callback to invoke to write the data.
        


### -param callbackState [in, optional]

A pointer to a user-defined state that is  passed to the callback function.
        


### -param error [in, optional]

A  pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/wsw/ws-error">WS_ERROR</a> object where additional information about the error should be stored if the function fails.
                


## -returns



This function can return one of these values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>

<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_INVALIDARG</b></dt>

<td width="60%">

</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>WS_E_INVALID_OPERATION</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The operation is not allowed due to the current state of the object.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



When writing with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/webservices/ns-webservices-ws_xml_writer_mtom_encoding">WS_XML_WRITER_MTOM_ENCODING</a>, <b>WsPushBytes</b> provides a way
        to write bytes directly into its own MIME part and avoid a copy.  However, the writer at its discretion,
        may choose to invoke the callback immediately, so the caller should be prepared for this.
      

If the encoding cannot take advantage of this behavior, then <b>WsPushBytes</b> will invoke the
        callback immediately and operate as if <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/webservices/nf-webservices-wswritebytes">WsWriteBytes</a> was called.
