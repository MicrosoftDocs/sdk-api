# WsReadBytes function


## -description


Reads text from the Reader and decodes the characters as bytes according to the base64 specification.
      


## -parameters




### -param reader [in]

A pointer to the <b>XML Reader</b> from which the bytes should be read.  The pointer must reference a valid <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/wsw/ws-xml-reader">WS_XML_READER</a> object.
        


### -param bytes

A pointer to a location to place the decoded bytes.


### -param maxByteCount [in]

The maximum number of bytes that should be read.


### -param actualByteCount [out]

A pointer to a ULONG value of 
          the actual number of bytes that were read.  This may be less than maxByteCount even when there
          are more bytes remaining.
        


### -param error [in, optional]

A  pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/wsw/ws-error">WS_ERROR</a> object where additional information about the error should be stored if the function fails.
                


## -returns



This function can return one of these values.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



Text is read up to either a start element or end element.  Comments are skipped, and CDATA content is treated
        identically to element content.
      

This function can fail for any of the reasons listed in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/webservices/nf-webservices-wsreadnode">WsReadNode</a>.
