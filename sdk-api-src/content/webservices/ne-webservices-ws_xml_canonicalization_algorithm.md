## -enum-fields

### -field WS_EXCLUSIVE_XML_CANONICALIZATION_ALGORITHM:0

The exclusive XML canonicalization algorithm
          represented by the URI 'http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n#' and
          defined in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3741">RFC 3741</a>.

### -field WS_EXCLUSIVE_WITH_COMMENTS_XML_CANONICALIZATION_ALGORITHM:1
