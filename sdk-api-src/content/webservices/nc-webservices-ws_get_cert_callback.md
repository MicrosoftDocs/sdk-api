# WS_GET_CERT_CALLBACK callback function


## -description


Provides a certificate to the security runtime.  This
callback is specified as part of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/webservices/ns-webservices-ws_custom_cert_credential">WS_CUSTOM_CERT_CREDENTIAL</a>, 
which in turn may be specified as part of a security binding that requires a 
certificate credential. The runtime will invoke this callback when the channel 
(client-side) or the listener (server-side) is opened.
            

Cert ownership: If this callback returns a success HRESULT, the caller
(namely, the security runtime) will take ownership of the returned
certificate, and will free it when the containing channel no longer
needs it.  If this callback returns a failure HRESULT, the caller will
NOT take ownership of, or even look at, the value returned in the out
parameter 'cert'.
