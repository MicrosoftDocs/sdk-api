# WS_USERNAME_CREDENTIAL structure


## -description


The abstract base type for all username/password credentials.
            

Note that <b>WS_USERNAME_CREDENTIAL</b> and its concrete subtypes
are used with the WS-Security <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/webservices/ns-webservices-ws_username_message_security_binding">WS_USERNAME_MESSAGE_SECURITY_BINDING</a>.  
They are best suitable for application-level username/password pairs, such as 
those used for online customer accounts.  The usernames and passwords specified 
are not interpreted by the security runtime, and are merely carried
client-to-server for authentication by the specified server-side
username/password validator specified by the application.
            

In contrast, the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/webservices/ns-webservices-ws_windows_integrated_auth_credential">WS_WINDOWS_INTEGRATED_AUTH_CREDENTIAL</a> and
its concrete subtypes are used for Windows Integrated Authentication
and the security bindings that use it.
            


## -struct-fields




### -field credentialType
