### -field Flags

Specifies one or more flags for this data source.  Can include WIM_ENTRY_FLAG_NOT_ACTIVE, indicating a data source which is removed or where the WIM file is not found, or WIM_ENTRY_FLAG_SUSPENDED indicating that the data source is not currently in use but could become in use on demand.  If neither flag is present, the WIM is in active use.
