# DSOBJECT structure


## -description


The <b>DSOBJECT</b> structure contains directory object data. An array of this structure is provided in the <b>aObjects</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dsclient/ns-dsclient-dsobjectnames">DSOBJECTNAMES</a> structure.


## -struct-fields




### -field dwFlags

Contains a set of flags that provide object data. This can be zero or a combination of one, or more, of the following values.



#### DSOBJECT_ISCONTAINER

The object is a container.



#### DSOBJECT_READONLYPAGES

When displaying properties for this object, the user interface must be read-only.


### -field dwProviderFlags

Contains a set of flags that provide data about the object provider. This can be zero or a combination of one or more of the following values.



#### DSPROVIDER_ADVANCED

The user interface for this object should be shown in an advanced mode.



#### DSPROVIDER_UNUSED_0

Not used.



#### DSPROVIDER_UNUSED_1

Not used.



#### DSPROVIDER_UNUSED_2

Not used.



#### DSPROVIDER_UNUSED_3

Not used.


### -field offsetName

Contains the offset, in bytes, from the start of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dsclient/ns-dsclient-dsobjectnames">DSOBJECTNAMES</a> structure to a NULL-terminated, Unicode string that contains the ADSPath of the object.

The following code example shows how to use this member.


```cpp
pwszName = (LPWSTR)((LPBYTE)pdsObjNames + 
    pdsObjNames->aObjects[i].offsetName);

```



### -field offsetClass

Contains the offset, in bytes, from the start of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dsclient/ns-dsclient-dsobjectnames">DSOBJECTNAMES</a> structure to a NULL-terminated, Unicode string that contains the class name of the object. Contains zero if the class name is unknown.

The following code example shows how to use this member.


```cpp
pwszClass = (LPWSTR)((LPBYTE)pdsObjNames + 
    pdsObjNames->aObjects[i].offsetClass);

```
