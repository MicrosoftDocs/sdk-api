# DOMAIN_TREE structure


## -description


The <b>DOMAINTREE</b> structure contains  data about a node in a domain tree obtained with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dsclient/nf-dsclient-idsbrowsedomaintree-getdomains">IDsBrowseDomainTree::GetDomains</a> method. Each of the domains in the tree  node are represented by a 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dsclient/ns-dsclient-domaindesc">DOMAINDESC</a> structure.


## -struct-fields




### -field dsSize

Contains the size, in bytes, of the <b>DOMAINTREE</b> structure and all <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dsclient/ns-dsclient-domaindesc">DOMAINDESC</a> structures in this <b>DOMAINTREE</b> structure.


### -field dwCount

Contains the number of  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dsclient/ns-dsclient-domaindesc">DOMAINDESC</a> structures in the <b>aDomains</b> array.


### -field aDomains

Contains an array of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dsclient/ns-dsclient-domaindesc">DOMAINDESC</a> structures that represent the domains. The array does not contain any child or sibling relational data. The relational data is contained within the <b>DOMAINDESC</b> structures.


## -remarks



For more information about how to access and use the data in this structure, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/AD/domain-browser">Domain Browser</a>.
