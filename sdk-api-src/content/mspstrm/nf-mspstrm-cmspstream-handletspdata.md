# CMSPStream::HandleTSPData


## -description


The 
<b>HandleTSPData</b> method may be called by the derived call object to let the stream handle the TSP commands. The default implementation returns S_OK. Override this method to implement the stream-specific portion of your MSP-TSP communication. Note that the base call object classes do not call this method; if you want to use it, you must also override the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mspcall/nf-mspcall-cmspcallbase-receivetspcalldata">ReceiveTSPCallData</a> method to dispatch the TSP data to your streams. The stream dispatch information, if any, will be contained in the opaque buffer.


## -parameters




### -param pData

Pointer to opaque buffer containing implementation-dependent information.


### -param dwSize

Size in bytes of opaque buffer.
