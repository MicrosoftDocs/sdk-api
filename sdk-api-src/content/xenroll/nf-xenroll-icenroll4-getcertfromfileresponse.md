# ICEnroll4::getCertFromFileResponse


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[This method is no longer available for use as of Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista.]

The <b>getCertFromFileResponse</b> method retrieves the certificate from a file containing a response from a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">certification authority</a>.
			 This method was first defined in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/xenroll/nn-xenroll-icenroll4">ICEnroll4</a> interface.


## -parameters




### -param strResponseFileName [in]

Specifies the name of the file that contains the response.


### -param pstrCert [out]

A pointer to a <b>BSTR</b> value that receives the certificate retrieved from the response. When you have finished using the <b>BSTR</b>, free it by calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oleauto/nf-oleauto-sysfreestring">SysFreeString</a> function.


## -returns



<h3>C++</h3>
 If the method succeeds, the method returns S_OK.

If the method fails, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value that indicates the error. For a list of common error codes, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/common-hresult-values">Common HRESULT Values</a>.

<h3>VB</h3>
 The return value is a <b>String</b> that contains a certificate.




## -remarks



The response contained in <i>strResponseFileName</i> must contain exactly one certificate; a child certificate cannot be present.

The response may be either a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/p-gly">PKCS #7</a> or a full <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">Certificate Management over CMS</a> (CMC) response. However, to accept a full CMC response, the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">cryptographic service provider</a> (CSP) must support <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/a-gly">Abstract Syntax Notation One</a> (ASN.1) encoding of CMC structures.

When this method is called from script, the method displays a user interface that asks whether the user will allow a read operation from the file system.
