# ICEnroll4::acceptResponse


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[This method is no longer available for use as of Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista.]

The <b>acceptResponse</b> method accepts delivery of the credentials issued in response to an earlier call to 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/xenroll/nf-xenroll-icenroll4-createrequest">createRequest</a> and places the credentials in the appropriate store.  This method was first defined in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/xenroll/nn-xenroll-icenroll4">ICEnroll4</a> interface.

The response may be a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/p-gly">PKCS #7</a> format or a full <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">Certificate Management over CMS</a> (CMC) response.


## -parameters




### -param strResponse [in]

A string that represents the base64-encoded response.


## -returns



<h3>VB</h3>
 If the method succeeds, the method returns S_OK.

If the method fails, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value that indicates the error. For a list of common error codes, see 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/common-hresult-values">Common HRESULT Values</a>.




## -remarks



The response must contain exactly one certificate; a child certificate cannot be present.

The response may be either a PKCS #7 or a full CMC response; however, to accept a full CMC response, the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">cryptographic service provider</a> must support <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/a-gly">Abstract Syntax Notation One</a> (ASN.1) encoding of CMC structures.

When this method is called from script, the method displays a user interface that asks whether the user will allow installation of a  certificate.
