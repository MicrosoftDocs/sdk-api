# IEnroll4::acceptResponseBlob


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[This method is no longer available for use as of Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista.]

The <b>acceptResponseBlob</b> method accepts delivery of the credentials issued in response to an earlier call to 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/xenroll/nf-xenroll-ienroll4-createrequestwstr">createRequestWStr</a> and places the credentials in the appropriate store.

The response may be a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/p-gly">PKCS #7</a> format or a full <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">Certificate Management over CMS</a> (CMC) response. This method was first defined in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/xenroll/nn-xenroll-ienroll4">IEnroll4</a> interface.


## -parameters




### -param pblobResponse [in]

A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/aa381414(v=vs.85)">CRYPT_DATA_BLOB</a> structure that represents the response.


## -remarks



The response must contain exactly one certificate; a child certificate cannot be present.

The response may be either a PKCS #7 or a full CMC response; however, to accept a full CMC response, the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">cryptographic service provider</a> must support <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/a-gly">Abstract Syntax Notation One</a> (ASN.1) encoding of CMC structures.
