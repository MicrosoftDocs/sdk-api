## -remarks



A user's account for logging onto Windows can be connected to an Internet identity. The user account can be a local account on a computer or a domain account for computers joined to a domain. The <b>USER_INFO_24</b> structure is used to provide information on an account which is connected to an Internet identity.

On Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, the Internet identity for a connected account can often be used instead of the computer account.
