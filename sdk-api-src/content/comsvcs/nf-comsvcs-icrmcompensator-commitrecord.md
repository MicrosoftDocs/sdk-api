## -description


Delivers a log record in forward order during the commit phase.


## -parameters




### -param crmLogRec [in]

The log record, as a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/ns-comsvcs-crmlogrecordread">CrmLogRecordRead</a> structure.


### -param pfForget [out]

Indicates whether the delivered record should be forgotten.


## -returns



If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



This method can be received by the CRM Compensator multiple times, once for each log record that is written. If no log records are written, the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-icrmcompensator-begincommit">BeginCommit</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-icrmcompensator-endcommit">EndCommit</a> methods are received but there are no <b>CommitRecord</b> method calls.

The CRM Compensator can choose to forget the record that was delivered to it during this phase by setting the forget flag on return from this method.
