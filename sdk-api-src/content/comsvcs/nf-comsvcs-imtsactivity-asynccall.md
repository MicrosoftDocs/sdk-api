# IMTSActivity::AsyncCall


## -description


Performs the user-defined work asynchronously.


## -parameters




### -param pCall [in]

A pointer to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nn-comsvcs-imtscall">IMTSCall</a> interface that is used to implement the batch work.


## -returns



This method can return the standard return values E_INVALIDARG, E_OUTOFMEMORY, E_UNEXPECTED, E_FAIL, and S_OK.




## -remarks



The batch work that is run using this method runs in the context and thread apartment of the activity that was created by the call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-mtscreateactivity">MTSCreateActivity</a>.


A return value of S_OK indicates that the batch work was accepted by the activity to run asynchronously. However, it does not necessarily mean that the batch work successfully completed.
