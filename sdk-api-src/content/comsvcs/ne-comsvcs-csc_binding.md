# CSC_Binding enumeration


## -description


Indicates whether all of the work that is submitted via the activity returned from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-cocreateactivity">CoCreateActivity</a> should be bound to only one single-threaded apartment (STA). This enumeration has no impact on the multithreaded apartment (MTA).


## -enum-fields




### -field CSC_NoBinding

The work submitted through the activity is not bound to a single STA.


### -field CSC_BindToPoolThread

The work submitted through the activity is bound to a single STA.


## -remarks



Binding all of the work submitted through the activity to a single STA involves a trade-off between avoiding the need to marshal interfaces to components used by many of the different bits of work versus needing to synchronize on a specific STA.

This enumeration is used only to set the thread pool binding for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/cossdk/cserviceconfig">CServiceConfig</a> when calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-cocreateactivity">CoCreateActivity</a>. An error is returned if you try to set the thread pool binding when calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-coenterservicedomain">CoEnterServiceDomain</a>. The values of this enumeration have no impact upon the MTA.
