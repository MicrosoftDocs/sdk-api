# ICrmCompensator::BeginAbort


## -description

Notifies the CRM Compensator of the abort phase of the transaction completion and that records are about to be delivered.

## -parameters

### -param fRecovery [in]

Indicates whether this method is being called during recovery.

## -returns

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

## -remarks

The abort phase can be received during normal processing without a prepare phase should the client decide to initiate abort.

The CRM Compensator should not depend on any state to be maintained between the prepare phase and this phase; the CRM infrastructure is free to release the CRM Compensator between these two phases if it needs to do so. However, state is maintained between the Begin-Record-End calls, and the CRM Compensator always gets the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nn-comsvcs-icrmlogcontrol">ICrmLogControl</a> interface before delivery of any transaction outcome methods.
