# IServiceActivity::BindToCurrentThread


## -description


Binds the user-defined batch work to the current thread.


## -parameters






## -returns



This method can return the standard return values E_INVALIDARG, E_OUTOFMEMORY, E_FAIL, and S_OK.




## -remarks



This method binds the batch work that is submitted via the AsynchronousCall or the SynchronousCall method to the current single-threaded apartment (STA). It has no effect if the current thread is being run in the multithreaded apartment (MTA). The current thread model is determined by the configuration of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nn-comsvcs-iservicethreadpoolconfig">IServiceThreadPoolConfig</a> interface of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/cossdk/cserviceconfig">CServiceConfig</a> object that is passed via the <i>pIUnknown</i> parameter during the call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-cocreateactivity">CoCreateActivity</a>.



Calling this method is equivalent to having called <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-iservicethreadpoolconfig-setbindinginfo">IServiceThreadPoolConfig::SetBindingInfo</a> with CSC_BindToPoolThread on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/cossdk/cserviceconfig">CServiceConfig</a> object that was passed through the <i>pIUnknown</i> parameter to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-cocreateactivity">CoCreateActivity</a>. However, after the activity has been created by <b>CoCreateActivity</b>, you can no longer call <b>IServiceThreadPoolConfig::SetBindingInfo</b> to change the thread binding. To change the thread binding after the activity has been created, you must call the <b>BindToCurrentThread</b> or the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-iserviceactivity-unbindfromthread">UnbindFromThread</a> method of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nn-comsvcs-iserviceactivity">IServiceActivity</a>.
