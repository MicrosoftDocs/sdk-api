# IComAppEvents interface


## -description

Notifies the subscriber if a COM+ server application is started, shut down, or forced to shut down.  The latter is initiated by the user calling a catalog method, such as <a href="/windows/desktop/api/comadmin/nf-comadmin-icomadmincatalog-shutdownapplication">ICOMAdminCatalog::ShutdownApplication</a>, to shut down the server. The events are published to the subscriber using the <a href="/windows/desktop/cossdk/com--events">COM+ Events</a> service, a loosely coupled events (LCE) system that stores event information from different publishers in an event store in the COM+ catalog.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IComAppEvents</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IComAppEvents</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
