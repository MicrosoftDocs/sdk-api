# IMtsEvents interface


## -description

Provides methods for obtaining information about the running package and establishing event sinks. The events are published to the subscriber using the <a href="/windows/desktop/cossdk/com--events">COM+ Events</a> service, a loosely coupled events system that stores event information from different publishers in an event store in the COM+ catalog.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IMtsEvents</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oaidl/nn-oaidl-idispatch">IDispatch</a> interface. <b>IMtsEvents</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
