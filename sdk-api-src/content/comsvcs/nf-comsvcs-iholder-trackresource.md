# IHolder::TrackResource


## -description


Tracks the resource.


## -parameters




### -param __MIDL__IHolder0003 [in]

The handle of the resource to be tracked. The Resource Dispenser has already created this resource before calling <b>TrackResource</b>.


## -returns



This method can return the following values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method completed successfully.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_INVALIDARG</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
<i>ResId</i> is not a valid resource handle.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_FAIL </b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method failed. The resource has not been tracked. The likely cause is that the caller's transaction is aborting.

</td>

</table>
 




## -remarks



Some resources are not kept in inventory; they are always manufactured on demand. The Holder is used only as a mechanism to automatically free the resources left at the end of an object's lifetime.

TrackResource tells the Holder that a resource should be tracked until it is freed by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-iholder-untrackresource">IHolder::UntrackResource</a>, or until the object that called <b>TrackResource</b> is released, at which time the Dispenser Manager automatically frees the resource.

If <b>TrackResource</b> is called from a transactional object, it calls back to the Resource Dispenser's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-idispenserdriver-enlistresource">IDispenserDriver::EnlistResource</a> method. The <b>EnlistResource</b> method can enlist the resource in the transaction, or it can return S_FALSE, indicating that the resource is not transaction capable and has not been enlisted.

This resource is eventually destroyed after both of the following are true: 



<ul>
<li>The Resource Dispenser calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-iholder-untrackresource">IHolder::UntrackResource</a> (most likely at the component's request), or the object's lifetime ends.</li>
<li>The transaction that the resource was enlisted in (if any) is done.</li>
</ul>
