# ObjectContext::EnableCommit


## -description

Declares that the current object's work is not necessarily finished but that its transactional updates are consistent and could be committed in their present form.

## -parameters

## -returns

This method can return the standard return values E_INVALIDARG, E_OUTOFMEMORY, and E_FAIL, as well as the following values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method completed succesfully and the object's transactional updates can now be committed.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_UNEXPECTED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
An unexpected error has occurred. This can happen if one object passes its <a href="/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nn-comsvcs-objectcontext">ObjectContext</a> pointer to another object and the other object calls <a href="/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-objectcontext-enablecommit">EnableCommit</a> using this pointer. An <b>ObjectContext</b> pointer is not valid outside the context of the object that originally obtained it.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## -remarks

When an object calls <b>EnableCommit</b>, it allows the transaction in which it's participating to be committed but it maintains its internal state across calls from its clients until it calls <a href="/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-objectcontext-setcomplete">SetComplete</a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-objectcontext-setabort">SetAbort</a> or until the transaction completes.

<b>EnableCommit</b> is the default state when an object is activated. Therefore, an object should always call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-objectcontext-setcomplete">SetComplete</a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-objectcontext-setabort">SetAbort</a> before returning from a method, unless you want the object to maintain its internal state for the next call from a client.
