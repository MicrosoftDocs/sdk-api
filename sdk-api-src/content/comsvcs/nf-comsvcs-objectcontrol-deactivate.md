# ObjectControl::Deactivate


## -description


Enables a COM+ object to perform cleanup required before it is recycled or destroyed.

This method is called by the COM+ run-time environment whenever an object is deactivated. Do not make any method calls on objects in the same activity from this method.


## -parameters






## -returns



This method can return the standard return values E_INVALIDARG, E_OUTOFMEMORY, E_UNEXPECTED, E_FAIL, and S_OK.




## -remarks



The COM+ run-time environment calls the <b>Deactivate</b> method whenever an object that supports the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nn-comsvcs-objectcontrol">ObjectControl</a> interface is deactivated. An object is deactivated when it returns from a method in which the method called <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-objectcontext-setcomplete">SetComplete</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-objectcontext-setabort">SetAbort</a>, when the transaction in which it executed is committed or aborted, or when the last client to hold a reference on the object releases its reference.

If the component supports recycling (returns <b>TRUE</b> from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-objectcontrol-canbepooled">CanBePooled</a> method), you must use the <b>Deactivate</b> method to reset the object's state to the state in which the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-objectcontrol-activate">Activate</a> method expects to find it. You can also use the <b>Deactivate</b> method to release the object's context or to do other context-specific cleanup. Even if an object supports recycling, it can be beneficial to release certain reusable resources in its <b>Deactivate</b> method. For example, ODBC provides its own connection pooling. It is more efficient to pool a database connection in a general connection pool where other objects can use it than it is to keep it tied to a specific object in an object pool.

COM+ expressly forbids calling into an object that exposes <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nn-comsvcs-objectcontrol">ObjectControl</a> after the <b>Deactivate</b> method has returned (when it is in its destructor). Such a call would result in an RPC_E_DISCONNECTED error. For example, if an object has passed out a reference to itself and then calls back into the object after <b>Deactivate</b> has returned, a disconnected error results.
