# IObjectContext::SetAbort


## -description


Declares that the transaction in which the object is executing must be aborted and that the object should be deactivated when it returns from the currently executing method call.


## -parameters






## -returns



This method can return the following values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method completed successfully.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_UNEXPECTED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
An unexpected error occurred. This can happen if one object passes its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nn-comsvcs-iobjectcontext">IObjectContext</a> pointer to another object and the other object calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-iobjectcontext-setabort">SetAbort</a> using this pointer. An <b>IObjectContext</b> pointer is not valid outside the context of the object that originally obtained it.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



The object is deactivated automatically on return from the method in which it called <b>SetAbort</b>. If the object is the root of an automatic transaction, COM+ aborts the transaction. If the object is transactional but not the root of an automatic transaction, the transaction in which it's participating is doomed to abort.

You can call <b>SetAbort</b> in error handlers to ensure that a transaction aborts when an error occurs. You can also call <b>SetAbort</b> at the beginning of a method to prevent your object from committing prematurely in the event of an unexpected return and then, if all goes well, call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/comsvcs/nf-comsvcs-iobjectcontext-setcomplete">SetComplete</a> just before the method returns.
