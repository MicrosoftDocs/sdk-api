# IComThreadEvents interface


## -description

Notifies the subscriber if a single-threaded apartment (STA) is created or terminated, and when an apartment thread is allocated. The subscriber is also notified if an activity is assigned or unassigned to an apartment thread. The events are published to the subscriber using the <a href="/windows/desktop/cossdk/com--events">COM+ Events</a> service, a loosely coupled events system that stores event information from different publishers in an event store in the COM+ catalog.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IComThreadEvents</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IComThreadEvents</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
