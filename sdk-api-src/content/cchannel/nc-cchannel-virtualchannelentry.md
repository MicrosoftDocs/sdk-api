# VIRTUALCHANNELENTRY callback function


## -description


An application-defined entry point for the client-side DLL of an application that uses Remote Desktop Services virtual channels. Remote Desktop Services calls this entry point to pass a set of function pointers to the client DLL. The client calls these functions to work with virtual channels. Your 
<b>VirtualChannelEntry</b> implementation must call the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/cchannel/nc-cchannel-virtualchannelinit">VirtualChannelInit</a> function to initialize access to virtual channels.


## -parameters




### -param pEntryPoints [in]

Pointer to a 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/cchannel/ns-cchannel-channel_entry_points">CHANNEL_ENTRY_POINTS</a> structure that contains pointers to the client-side virtual channel functions.

This pointer is no longer valid after the 
<b>VirtualChannelEntry</b> function returns. You must make a copy of this structure in extension-allocated memory for later use.


## -returns



Return <b>TRUE</b> if the function is successful.

Return <b>FALSE</b> if an error occurs. In this case, Remote Desktop Services unloads your DLL.
