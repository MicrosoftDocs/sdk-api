# VIRTUALCHANNELINIT callback function


## -description


Initializes a client DLL's access to Remote Desktop Services virtual channels. The client calls <b>VirtualChannelInit</b> to register the 
    names of its virtual channels.

Remote Desktop Services provides a pointer to a <b>VirtualChannelInit</b> function in the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/cchannel/ns-cchannel-channel_entry_points">CHANNEL_ENTRY_POINTS</a> structure passed to 
    your <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/cchannel/nc-cchannel-virtualchannelentry">VirtualChannelEntry</a> entry point.


## -parameters




### -param *ppInitHandle [in]

Pointer to a variable that receives a handle that identifies the client connection. Use this handle to 
      identify the client in subsequent calls to the 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/cchannel/nc-cchannel-virtualchannelopen">VirtualChannelOpen</a> function.


### -param pChannel [in, out]

Pointer to an array of CHANNEL_DEF 
      structures. Each structure contains the name and initialization options of a virtual channel that the client 
      DLL will open. Note that the <b>VirtualChannelInit</b> call does not open these 
      virtual channels; it only reserves the names for use by this application.


### -param channelCount [in]

Specifies the number of entries in the <i>pChannel</i> array.


### -param versionRequested [in]

Specifies the level of virtual channel support. Set this parameter to <b>VIRTUAL_CHANNEL_VERSION_WIN2000</b>.


### -param pChannelInitEventProc [in]

Pointer to an application-defined 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/cchannel/nc-cchannel-channel_init_event_fn">VirtualChannelInitEvent</a> function that 
      Remote Desktop Services calls to notify the client DLL of virtual channel events.


## -returns



If the function succeeds, the return value is <b>CHANNEL_RC_OK</b>.

If an error occurs, the function returns one of the following values.




## -remarks



You can call the <b>VirtualChannelInit</b> function only from your 
   <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/cchannel/nc-cchannel-virtualchannelentry">VirtualChannelEntry</a> function. 
   Calls to <b>VirtualChannelInit</b> at any other time fail.

When <b>VirtualChannelInit</b> returns successfully, Remote Desktop Services has 
   registered the requested channels. However, Remote Desktop Services may not have completed other initialization. When 
   all initialization is complete, Remote Desktop Services calls your 
   <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/cchannel/nc-cchannel-channel_init_event_fn">VirtualChannelInitEvent</a> 
   callback function with the <b>CHANNEL_EVENT_INITIALIZED</b> event.

You should not make assumptions about the number of available virtual channels before calling this function, 
   because the system and other plug-ins may have reserved virtual channels. Therefore, you should always check for a 
   <b>CHANNEL_RC_TOO_MANY_CHANNELS</b> return code after calling this function.

When <b>VirtualChannelInit</b> returns, the <b>options</b> member of each 
   CHANNEL_DEF structure includes 
   <b>CHANNEL_OPTION_INITIALIZED</b> if the channel was successfully initialized.

The maximum number of channels per client session is <b>CHANNEL_MAX_COUNT</b>.
