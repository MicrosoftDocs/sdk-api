# IRedbookDiscMaster::AddAudioTrackBlocks


## -description


Adds blocks of audio data to the currently open track. This method can be called repeatedly until there is no space available or the track is full.


## -parameters




### -param pby [in]

Pointer to an array of track blocks. The format is 44.1 KHz 16-bit stereo RAW audio samples, in the same format as used by WAV in the data section.


### -param cb [in]

Size of the array, in bytes. This count must be a multiple of the audio block size.


## -returns



S_OK is returned on success, but other success codes may be returned as a result of implementation. The following error codes are commonly returned on operation failure, but do not represent the only possible error values:




## -remarks



After all blocks are added, call the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/imapi/nf-imapi-iredbookdiscmaster-closeaudiotrack">CloseAudioTrack</a> method to finish the track.

If a call to this method would overrun the number of available audio blocks, then the method will return IMAPI_E_DISCFULL and keep as much of the audio data as it can. In contrast, the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/imapi/nf-imapi-ijolietdiscmaster-adddata">IJolietDiscMaster::AddData</a> method does not keep any of the data, so there are no bad files.
