# IDiscMaster::RecordDisc


## -description


Burns the staged image to media in the active disc recorder.


## -parameters




### -param bSimulate [in]

Indicates whether the media is burned. If this parameter is <b>TRUE</b>, media in the active disc recorder is not actually burned. Instead, a simulated burn is performed. The simulation is a good test of a disc recorder, because most of the operations are performed as in a real burn. If this parameter is <b>FALSE</b>, then the media in the recorder is actually burned.


### -param bEjectAfterBurn [in]

Indicates whether to eject the media after the burn. If this parameter is <b>TRUE</b>, the media is ejected. If this parameter is <b>FALSE</b>, the media is not ejected.


## -returns



S_OK is returned on success, but other success codes may be returned as a result of implementation. The following error codes are commonly returned on operation failure, but do not represent the only possible error values:




## -remarks



This method returns when the burn is complete, although progress callbacks are made if registered with the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/imapi/nf-imapi-idiscmaster-progressadvise">ProgressAdvise</a> method. Any errors cause this method to return, with little or no corrective action on the part of this method. 

The staged image data is not valid after a call to 
<b>RecordDisc</b>. This allows the application to perform either a simulated or actual burn of the media. For security, the contents of the stash file are cleared automatically after successful completion of the first call to this method. A disc must be restaged to burn it again.

The 
<b>RecordDisc</b> method expects to work with blank media for audio. Otherwise, the media may need to be erased (for example, CD-RW media in a CD-RW drive). See 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/imapi/nf-imapi-idiscrecorder-erase">IDiscRecorder::Erase</a>.

The 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/imapi/nf-imapi-idiscmaster-setactivediscrecorder">SetActiveDiscRecorder</a> method determines if there is an IMAPI multi-session disc in the active drive upon setting. If so, IMAPI goes into multi-session mode automatically. If in multi-session mode and a call is made to 
<b>RecordDisc</b>, the same disc that established multi-session mode must be in the active recorder or an error code of IMAPI_E_WRONGDISC will be returned.
