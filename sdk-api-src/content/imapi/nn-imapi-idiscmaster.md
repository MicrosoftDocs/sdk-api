# IDiscMaster interface


## -description

The 
<b>IDiscMaster</b> interface allows an application to reserve an image mastering API, enumerate disc mastering formats and disc recorders supported by an image mastering object, and start a simulated or actual burn of a disc. Although an image mastering object can support several formats, it may not be possible to access all formats through a specific recorder. For this reason, you must select a recorder with 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/imapi/nf-imapi-idiscmaster-setactivediscrecorder">SetActiveDiscRecorder</a> after selecting a format with 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/imapi/nf-imapi-idiscmaster-setactivediscmasterformat">SetActiveDiscMasterFormat</a>.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IDiscMaster</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IDiscMaster</b> also has these types of members:
