# IDiscRecorder::SetRecorderProperties


## -description


Accepts an 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/propidl/nn-propidl-ipropertystorage">IPropertyStorage</a> pointer for an object with all the properties that the application wishes to change. Sparse settings are supported. It is recommended, however, to query for a property set using 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/imapi/nf-imapi-idiscrecorder-getrecorderproperties">GetRecorderProperties</a>, modify only those settings of interest, and then call 
<b>SetRecorderProperties</b> to change all values simultaneously.


## -parameters




### -param pPropStg [in]

Pointer to the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/propidl/nn-propidl-ipropertystorage">IPropertyStorage</a> interface that the disc recorder can use to retrieve new settings on various properties.


## -returns



S_OK is returned on success, but other success codes may be returned as a result of implementation. The following error codes are commonly returned on operation failure, but do not represent the only possible error values:




## -remarks



Some properties are read-only, such as MaxWriteSpeed. Both read-only properties and unsupported properties are ignored without generating an error (see IMAPI_S_PROPERTIESIGNORED). For example, someone could submit a property set to this interface and attempt to change the MaxWriteSpeed and ClearlyNeverHeardOfBefore properties. Since MaxWriteSpeed is read-only and ClearlyNeverHeardOfBefore is an unknown value, both properties are ignored and the method succeeds.

After calling 
<b>SetRecorderProperties</b>, an application should verify property settings by calling 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/imapi/nf-imapi-idiscrecorder-getrecorderproperties">GetRecorderProperties</a>.
