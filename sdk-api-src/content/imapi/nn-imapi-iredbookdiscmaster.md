# IRedbookDiscMaster interface


## -description

The 
<b>IRedbookDiscMaster</b> interface enables the staging of an audio CD image. It represents one of the formats supported by <b>MSDiscMasterObj</b>, and it allows the creation of multi-track audio discs in Track-at-Once mode (fixed-size audio gaps).

Tracks are created in the stash file, data is added to them, and then they are closed. Only one track is staged at a time; this is called the <i>open track</i>. The remaining tracks are closed and committed to the image, while the open track has available to it all the blocks that are not in use by closed tracks.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IRedbookDiscMaster</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IRedbookDiscMaster</b> also has these types of members:
