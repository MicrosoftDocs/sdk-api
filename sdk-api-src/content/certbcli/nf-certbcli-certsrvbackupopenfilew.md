# CertSrvBackupOpenFileW function


## -description


The <b>CertSrvBackupOpenFile</b> function opens a file for backup.


## -parameters




### -param hbc [in]

A handle to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">Certificate Services</a> backup context.


### -param pwszAttachmentName [in]

File name to open for backup purposes. This file name would be parsed from a list produced by means of 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/certbcli/nf-certbcli-certsrvbackupgetbackuplogsw">CertSrvBackupGetBackupLogs</a> or 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/certbcli/nf-certbcli-certsrvbackupgetdatabasenamesw">CertSrvBackupGetDatabaseNames</a>. Note that the names returned by <b>CertSrvBackupGetBackupLogs</b> and <b>CertSrvBackupGetDatabaseNames</b> must have the single-WCHAR CSBFT_* prefix stripped before <b>CertSrvBackupOpenFile</b> is called.


### -param cbReadHintSize [in]

Number of bytes used as a hint when the file is read by 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/certbcli/nf-certbcli-certsrvbackupread">CertSrvBackupRead</a>. The <i>cbReadHintSize</i> parameter passed to the first <b>CertSrvBackupOpenFile</b> call for the backup context is used to size the read buffer. Pass zero for this parameter, and the buffer will be sized at a reasonably efficient size chosen by <b>CertSrvBackupOpenFile</b>. If insufficient memory is available, the buffer size will be reduced until memory allocation succeeds or until the buffer size reaches its minimum possible value. Pass a nonzero size to cause <b>CertSrvBackupOpenFile</b> to size the buffer to a power of two near the value of <i>cbReadHintSize</i>. The  implementation will choose only powers of two between 64 KB and 4 MB.


### -param pliFileSize [out]

A pointer to a <b>LARGE_INTEGER</b> value that represents the number of bytes in the file.


## -returns



If the function succeeds, the function returns S_OK.

If the function fails, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value that indicates the error. For a list of common error codes, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/common-hresult-values">Common HRESULT Values</a>.




## -remarks



Use this function to open a file for backup purposes. When you have finished using the file, close the file by calling 
the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/certbcli/nf-certbcli-certsrvbackupclose">CertSrvBackupClose</a> function.

The name of this  function in Certadm.dll is <b>CertSrvBackupOpenFileW</b>. You must use this form of the name when calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress">GetProcAddress</a>. Also, this function is defined as type <b>FNCERTSRVBACKUPOPENFILEW</b> in  Certbcli.h.


#### Examples


```cpp
FNCERTSRVBACKUPOPENFILEW* pfnOpenFile;
char * szBackupOpenFunc = "CertSrvBackupOpenFileW";
LARGE_INTEGER liFileSize;
HRESULT       hr=0;

// Get the address for the desired function.    
// hInst was set by calling LoadLibrary for Certadm.dll.
pfnOpenFile = (FNCERTSRVBACKUPOPENFILEW*)GetProcAddress(hInst,
                                         szBackupOpenFunc);
if ( NULL == pfnOpenFile )
{
    printf("Failed GetProcAddress - %s, error=%d\n",
            szBackupOpenFunc,
            GetLastError() );
    exit(1); // or other appropriate error action
}

// Open the file.
// hCSBC was set by an earlier call to CertSrvBackupPrepare.
// pwszFile specifies the name of a file.
// This name could have resulted from parsing the
// output from CertSrvBackupGetDatabaseNames, and so on.
hr = pfnOpenFile(hCSBC,
                pwszFile,
                0,
                &liFileSize);
if (FAILED(hr))
{
    printf("Failed pfnOpenFile call [%x] %ws\n",
           hr,
           pwszFile);
           exit(1); // Or other appropriate error action.
}

// Use the opened file as needed.
// When you have finished using the file, call CertSrvBackupClose.
// ...
```
