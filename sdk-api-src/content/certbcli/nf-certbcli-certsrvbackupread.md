# CertSrvBackupRead function


## -description


The <b>CertSrvBackupRead</b> function reads bytes from a Certificate Services file.


## -parameters




### -param hbc [in]

A handle to a Certificate Services backup context.


### -param pvBuffer [out]

Void pointer to storage which will contain bytes read from the file being backed up.


### -param cbBuffer [in]

Size of the storage area referenced by <i>pvBuffer</i>.


### -param pcbRead [out]

A pointer to a <b>DWORD</b> value which represents the actual number of bytes read by <b>CertSrvBackupRead</b>. The number of bytes read can be less than the size of the storage area allocated to <i>pvBuffer</i> if the end of the file has been reached.


## -returns



The return value is an <b>HRESULT</b>. A value of S_OK indicates success.




## -remarks



After opening the file for backup purposes (using 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/certbcli/nf-certbcli-certsrvbackupopenfilew">CertSrvBackupOpenFile</a>), call <b>CertSrvBackupRead</b> to retrieve the contents of the file, and call an application-specific routine to write the contents to a backup medium. <b>CertSrvBackupRead</b> and the application-specific routine can be placed in a loop until all the bytes of the file are read and backed up. When done reading the file, close it by calling 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/certbcli/nf-certbcli-certsrvbackupclose">CertSrvBackupClose</a>.


#### Examples


```cpp

#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <Certbcli.h>

#define BUFFSIZE 524288

FNCERTSRVBACKUPREAD* pfnRead;
char * szBackupReadFunc = "CertSrvBackupRead";
BYTE       ReadBuff[BUFFSIZE];
DWORD      cbRead=0;
HRESULT    hr=0;

// Get the address for the desired function.    
// hInst was set by calling LoadLibrary for Certadm.dll.
pfnRead = (FNCERTSRVBACKUPREAD*)GetProcAddress(hInst,
                                          szBackupReadFunc);
if ( NULL == pfnRead )
{
    printf("Failed GetProcAddress - %s, error=%d\n",
           szBackupReadFunc,
           GetLastError() );
    exit(1); // Or other appropriate error action.
}

// Read the file.
// hCSBC represents an HCSBC used in
// an earlier call to CertSrvBackupOpenFile.
// To read the entire file, this code
// would be placed in a loop.
hr = pfnRead( hCSBC,
              &ReadBuff,
              BUFFSIZE,
              &cbRead );
if (FAILED(hr))
{
    printf("Failed pfnRead call [%x]\n", hr);
    exit(1); // Or other appropriate error action.
}

// Use the bytes read as needed. For example,
// in an application-specific routine to back
// up the file contents.
// ...
```
