## -description

Enables clients to get pointers to other interfaces on a given object through the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-queryinterface(q)">QueryInterface</a> method, and manage the existence of the object through the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-addref">AddRef</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-release">Release</a> methods. All other COM interfaces are inherited, directly or indirectly, from <b>IUnknown</b>. Therefore, the three methods in <b>IUnknown</b> are the first entries in the vtable for every interface.
