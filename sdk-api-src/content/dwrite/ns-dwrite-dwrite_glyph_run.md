# DWRITE_GLYPH_RUN structure


## -description


Contains the information needed by renderers to draw glyph runs. 
	 All coordinates are in device independent pixels (DIPs).
  


## -struct-fields




### -field fontFace

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritefontface">IDWriteFontFace</a>*</b>

The physical font face object to draw with.


### -field fontEmSize

Type: <b>FLOAT</b>

The logical size of the font in DIPs (equals 1/96 inch), not points.


### -field glyphCount

Type: <b>UINT32</b>

The number of glyphs in the glyph run.


### -field glyphIndices

Type: <b>const UINT16*</b>

A pointer to an array of indices to render for the glyph run.


### -field glyphAdvances

Type: <b>const FLOAT*</b>

A pointer to an array containing glyph advance widths for the glyph run.


### -field glyphOffsets

Type: <b>const <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/ns-dwrite-dwrite_glyph_offset">DWRITE_GLYPH_OFFSET</a>*</b>

A pointer to an array containing glyph offsets for the glyph run.


### -field isSideways

Type: <b>BOOL</b>

If true, specifies that glyphs are rotated 90 degrees to the left and vertical metrics are used. Vertical writing is achieved by specifying <b>isSideways</b> = true and rotating the entire run 90 degrees to the right via a rotate transform.


### -field bidiLevel

Type: <b>UINT32</b>

The implicit resolved bidi level of the run. Odd levels indicate right-to-left languages like Hebrew and Arabic, while even levels indicate left-to-right languages like English and Japanese (when written horizontally). For right-to-left languages, the text origin is on the right, and text should be drawn to the left.
