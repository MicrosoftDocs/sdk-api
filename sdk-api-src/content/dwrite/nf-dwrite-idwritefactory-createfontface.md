A value that indicates the type of file format of the font face.


### -param numberOfFiles

Type: <b>UINT32</b>

The number of font files, in element count, required to represent the font face.


### -param fontFiles [in]

Type: <b>const <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritefontfile">IDWriteFontFile</a>*</b>

A font file object representing the font face.  Because <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritefontface">IDWriteFontFace</a>maintains its own references

The zero-based index of a font face, in cases when the font files contain a collection of font faces.
     If the font files contain a single face, this value should be zero.


### -param fontFaceSimulationFlags

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/ne-dwrite-dwrite_font_simulations">DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS</a></b>

A value that indicates which, if any, font face simulation flags for algorithmic means of making text bold or italic are applied to the current font face.


### -param fontFace [out]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritefontface">IDWriteFontFace</a>**</b>

When this method returns, contains an address of a pointer to the newly created font face object, or <b>NULL</b> in case of failure.


## -returns
