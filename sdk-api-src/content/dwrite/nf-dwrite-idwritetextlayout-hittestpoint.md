# IDWriteTextLayout::HitTestPoint


## -description


 The application calls this function passing in a specific pixel location
     relative to the top-left location of the layout box and obtains the
     information about the correspondent hit-test metrics of the text string
     where the hit-test has occurred. When the specified pixel location is
     outside the text string, the function sets the output value <i>*isInside</i> to
     <b>FALSE</b>.


## -parameters




### -param pointX

Type: <b>FLOAT</b>

The pixel location X to hit-test, relative to the top-left location of the layout box.


### -param pointY

Type: <b>FLOAT</b>

The pixel location Y to hit-test, relative to the top-left location of the layout box.


### -param isTrailingHit [out]

Type: <b>BOOL*</b>

An output flag that indicates whether the hit-test location is at the leading or the trailing
         side of the character. When the output <i>*isInside</i> value is set to <b>FALSE</b>, this value is set according to the output
         <i>hitTestMetrics-&gt;textPosition</i> value to represent the edge closest to the hit-test location.


### -param isInside [out]

Type: <b>BOOL*</b>

An output flag that indicates whether the hit-test location is inside the text string.
         When <b>FALSE</b>, the position nearest the text's edge is returned.


### -param hitTestMetrics [out]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/ns-dwrite-dwrite_hit_test_metrics">DWRITE_HIT_TEST_METRICS</a>*</b>

The output geometry fully enclosing the hit-test location. When the output <i>*isInside</i> value
         is set to <b>FALSE</b>, this structure represents the geometry enclosing the edge closest to the hit-test location.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.
