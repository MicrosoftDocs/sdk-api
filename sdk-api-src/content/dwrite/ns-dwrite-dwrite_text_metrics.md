### -field maxBidiReorderingDepth

Type: <b>UINT32</b>

The maximum reordering count of any line of text, used 
	  to calculate the most number of hit-testing boxes needed. 
	  If the layout has no bidirectional text, or no text at all,

### -field lineCount

Type: <b>UINT32</b>

Total number of lines.
