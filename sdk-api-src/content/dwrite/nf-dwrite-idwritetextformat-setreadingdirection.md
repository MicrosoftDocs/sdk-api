# IDWriteTextFormat::SetReadingDirection


## -description

Sets the paragraph reading direction.

## -parameters

### -param readingDirection

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/ne-dwrite-dwrite_reading_direction">DWRITE_READING_DIRECTION</a></b>

The text reading direction (for example, <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/ne-dwrite-dwrite_reading_direction">DWRITE_READING_DIRECTION_RIGHT_TO_LEFT</a> for languages, such as 
            Arabic, that read from right to left) for a paragraph.

## -returns

Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

## -remarks

The reading direction and flow direction must always be set 90 degrees orthogonal to each other, or else you will get the error DWRITE_E_FLOWDIRECTIONCONFLICTS when you 
        use layout functions like Draw or GetMetrics. So if you set a vertical reading direction (for example, to DWRITE_READING_DIRECTION_TOP_TO_BOTTOM), then you must also 
        use SetFlowDirection to set the flow direction appropriately (for example, to DWRITE_FLOW_DIRECTION_RIGHT_TO_LEFT).
