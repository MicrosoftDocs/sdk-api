# DWRITE_TRIMMING structure


## -description

Specifies the trimming option for text overflowing the layout box.

## -struct-fields

### -field granularity

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/ne-dwrite-dwrite_trimming_granularity">DWRITE_TRIMMING_GRANULARITY</a></b>

A value that specifies  the text granularity used to trim text overflowing the layout box.

### -field delimiter

Type: <b>UINT32</b>

A character code used as the delimiter that signals the beginning of the portion of text to be preserved. 
          Text starting from the Nth occurrence of the delimiter (where N equals delimiterCount) counting backwards from the end of the text block will be preserved.
          For example, given the text is a path like c:\A\B\C\D\file.txt and delimiter equal to '\' and delimiterCount equal to 1, the file.txt portion of the text would be preserved.  
          Specifying a delimiterCount of 2 would preserve D\file.txt.

### -field delimiterCount

Type: <b>UINT32</b>

The delimiter count, counting from the end of the text, to preserve text from.
