# IDWriteFactory::RegisterFontFileLoader


## -description


 Registers a font file loader with DirectWrite.


## -parameters




### -param fontFileLoader

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritefontfileloader">IDWriteFontFileLoader</a>*</b>

Pointer to a <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritefontfileloader">IDWriteFontFileLoader</a> object for a particular file resource type.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



 This function registers a font file loader with DirectWrite.
     The font file loader interface, which should be implemented   by a singleton object, handles loading font file resources of a particular type from a key.
     A given instance can only be registered once.
     Succeeding attempts will return an error, indicating that it has already been registered.
     Note that font file loader implementations must not register themselves with DirectWrite
     inside their constructors, and must not unregister themselves inside their destructors, because
     registration and unregistraton operations increment and decrement the object reference count respectively.
     Instead, registration and unregistration with DirectWrite of font file loaders should be performed
     outside of the font file loader implementation.
