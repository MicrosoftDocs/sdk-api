# DWRITE_GLYPH_OFFSET structure


## -description


The optional adjustment to a glyph's position.


## -struct-fields




### -field advanceOffset

Type: <b>FLOAT</b>

The offset in the advance direction of the run. A positive advance offset moves the glyph to the right (in pre-transform coordinates) if the run is left-to-right or to the left if the run is right-to-left.


### -field ascenderOffset

Type: <b>FLOAT</b>

The offset in the ascent direction, that is, the direction ascenders point. A positive ascender offset moves the glyph up (in pre-transform coordinates).  A negative ascender offset moves the glyph down.


## -remarks



An glyph offset changes the position of a glyph without affecting the pen position. Offsets are in logical, pre-transform units.
