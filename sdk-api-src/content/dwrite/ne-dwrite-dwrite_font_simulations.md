# DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS enumeration


## -description


Specifies algorithmic style simulations to be applied to the font face. Bold and oblique simulations can be combined via bitwise OR operation.


## -enum-fields




### -field DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS_NONE

Indicates that no simulations are applied to the font face.


### -field DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS_BOLD

Indicates that algorithmic emboldening is applied to the font face.  <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/ne-dwrite-dwrite_font_simulations">DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS_BOLD</a> increases weight by applying a widening algorithm to the glyph outline. This may  be used to simulate a bold weight where no designed bold weight is available.


### -field DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS_OBLIQUE

Indicates that algorithmic italicization is applied to the font face. <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/ne-dwrite-dwrite_font_simulations">DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS_OBLIQUE</a> applies obliquing (shear) to the glyph outline. This may be used to simulate an oblique/italic style where no designed oblique/italic style is available.


## -remarks



Style simulations are not recommended for good typographic quality.
