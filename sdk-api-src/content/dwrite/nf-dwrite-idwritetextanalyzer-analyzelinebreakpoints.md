# IDWriteTextAnalyzer::AnalyzeLineBreakpoints


## -description

 Analyzes a text range for potential breakpoint opportunities, reading
     attributes from the source and reporting breakpoint opportunities to
     the sink callback <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nf-dwrite-idwritetextanalysissink-setlinebreakpoints">SetLineBreakpoints</a>.

## -parameters

### -param analysisSource

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritetextanalysissource">IDWriteTextAnalysisSource</a>*</b>

A pointer to the source object to analyze.

### -param textPosition

Type: <b>UINT32</b>

The starting text position within the source object.

### -param textLength

Type: <b>UINT32</b>

The text length to analyze.

### -param analysisSink

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritetextanalysissink">IDWriteTextAnalysisSink</a>*</b>

A pointer to the  sink callback object that receives the text analysis.

## -returns

Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

## -remarks

 Although the function can handle multiple paragraphs, the text range
     should not arbitrarily split the middle of paragraphs, unless the
     specified text span is considered a whole unit. Otherwise, the
     returned properties for the first and last characters will
     inappropriately allow breaks.
