# IDWriteGlyphRunAnalysis::GetAlphaTextureBounds


## -description

 Gets the bounding rectangle of the physical pixels affected by the glyph run.

## -parameters

### -param textureType

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/ne-dwrite-dwrite_texture_type">DWRITE_TEXTURE_TYPE</a></b>

Specifies the type of texture requested. If a bi-level texture is requested, the
     bounding rectangle includes only bi-level glyphs. Otherwise, the bounding rectangle includes only antialiased
     glyphs.

### -param textureBounds [out]

Type: <b>RECT*</b>

When this method returns, contains the bounding rectangle of the physical pixels affected by the glyph run, or an empty rectangle if there are no glyphs
     of the specified texture type.

## -returns

Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.
