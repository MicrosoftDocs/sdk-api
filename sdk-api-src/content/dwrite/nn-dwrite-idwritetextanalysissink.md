# IDWriteTextAnalysisSink interface


## -description

This interface is implemented by the text analyzer's client to receive the
 output of a given text analysis.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IDWriteTextAnalysisSink</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/win32/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IDWriteTextAnalysisSink</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

The text analyzer disregards any current
 state of the analysis sink, therefore, a Set method call on a range overwrites the previously set analysis result of the same range.
