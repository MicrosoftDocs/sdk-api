### -field DWRITE_INFORMATIONAL_STRING_WIN32_SUBFAMILY_NAMES

Indicates the string containing a GDI-compatible subfamily name.

### -field DWRITE_INFORMATIONAL_STRING_TYPOGRAPHIC_FAMILY_NAMES

### -field DWRITE_INFORMATIONAL_STRING_TYPOGRAPHIC_SUBFAMILY_NAMES

### -field DWRITE_INFORMATIONAL_STRING_SAMPLE_TEXT

Contains sample text for display in font lists. This can be the font name or any other text that the designer thinks is the best 

example to display the font in.

### -field DWRITE_INFORMATIONAL_STRING_FULL_NAME

### -field DWRITE_INFORMATIONAL_STRING_SUPPORTED_SCRIPT_LANGUAGE_TAG

### -field DWRITE_INFORMATIONAL_STRING_PREFERRED_FAMILY_NAMES

Indicates the string containing the family name preferred by the designer. This enables font designers to group more than four fonts in a single family without losing compatibility with GDI. This name is typically only present if it differs from the GDI-compatible family name.

### -field DWRITE_INFORMATIONAL_STRING_PREFERRED_SUBFAMILY_NAMES

Indicates the string containing the subfamily name preferred by the designer. This name is typically only present if it differs from the GDI-compatible subfamily name.

### -field DWRITE_INFORMATIONAL_STRING_WWS_FAMILY_NAME
