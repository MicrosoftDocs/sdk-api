# IDWriteGlyphRunAnalysis::CreateAlphaTexture


## -description


 Creates an alpha texture of the specified type for glyphs within a specified bounding rectangle.


## -parameters




### -param textureType

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/ne-dwrite-dwrite_texture_type">DWRITE_TEXTURE_TYPE</a></b>

A value that specifies the type of texture requested. This can be <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/ne-dwrite-dwrite_texture_type">DWRITE_TEXTURE_BILEVEL_1x1</a> or <b>DWRITE_TEXTURE_CLEARTYPE_3x1</b>. If a bi-level texture is requested, the
     texture contains only bi-level glyphs. Otherwise, the texture contains only antialiased glyphs.


### -param textureBounds [in]

Type: <b>const RECT*</b>

The bounding rectangle of the texture, which can be different than
     the bounding rectangle returned by <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nf-dwrite-idwriteglyphrunanalysis-getalphatexturebounds">GetAlphaTextureBounds</a>.


### -param alphaValues [out]

Type: <b>BYTE*</b>

When this method returns, contains  the array of alpha values from the texture. The buffer allocated for this array must be at least the size of <i>bufferSize</i>.


### -param bufferSize

Type: <b>UINT32</b>

The size of the <i>alphaValues</i> array, in bytes. The minimum size depends on the dimensions of the
     rectangle and the type of texture requested.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.
