# IDWriteFontFace::GetDesignGlyphMetrics


## -description


 Obtains ideal (resolution-independent) glyph metrics in font design units. 


## -parameters




### -param glyphIndices [in]

Type: <b>const UINT16*</b>

 An array of glyph indices for which to compute  metrics. The array must contain at least as many elements as specified by <i>glyphCount</i>.


### -param glyphCount

Type: <b>UINT32</b>

The number of elements in the <i>glyphIndices</i> array.


### -param glyphMetrics [out]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/ns-dwrite-dwrite_glyph_metrics">DWRITE_GLYPH_METRICS</a>*</b>

When this method returns, contains an array of DWRITE_GLYPH_METRICS structures.  <i>glyphMetrics</i> must be initialized with an empty buffer that contains at least as many elements as <i>glyphCount</i>.
     The metrics returned by this function are in font design units.


### -param isSideways

Type: <b>BOOL</b>

Indicates whether the font is being used in a sideways run. This can affect the glyph metrics if the font has oblique simulation
    because sideways oblique simulation differs from non-sideways oblique simulation


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.




## -remarks



Design glyph metrics are used for glyph positioning.
