# IDWriteFactory::CreateGdiCompatibleTextLayout


## -description

 Takes a string, format, and associated constraints,
     and produces an object representing the result, formatted for a particular display resolution
     and measuring mode.

## -parameters

### -param string [in]

Type: <b>const WCHAR*</b>

An array of characters that contains the string to create a new <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritetextlayout">IDWriteTextLayout</a> object from. This array must be of length <i>stringLength</i> and can contain embedded <b>NULL</b> characters.

### -param stringLength

Type: <b>UINT32</b>

The length of the string, in character count.

### -param textFormat

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritetextformat">IDWriteTextFormat</a>*</b>

The text formatting object to apply to the string.

### -param layoutWidth

Type: <b>FLOAT</b>

The width of the layout box.

### -param layoutHeight

Type: <b>FLOAT</b>

The height of the layout box.

### -param pixelsPerDip

Type: <b>FLOAT</b>

The number of physical pixels per DIP (device independent pixel). For example, if rendering onto a 96 DPI device <i>pixelsPerDip</i>is 1. If rendering onto a 120 DPI device <i>pixelsPerDip</i> is 1.25 (120/96).

### -param transform [in, optional]

Type: <b>const <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/ns-dwrite-dwrite_matrix">DWRITE_MATRIX</a>*</b>

An optional transform applied to the glyphs and their positions. This transform is applied after the
     scaling specifies the font size and pixels per DIP.

### -param useGdiNatural

Type: <b>BOOL</b>

 Instructs the text layout to use the same metrics as GDI bi-level text when set to <b>FALSE</b>.
     When set to <b>TRUE</b>, instructs the text layout to use the same metrics as text measured by GDI using a font
     created with <b>CLEARTYPE_NATURAL_QUALITY</b>.

### -param textLayout [out]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritetextlayout">IDWriteTextLayout</a>**</b>

When this method returns, contains an address to the pointer of the resultant text layout object.

## -returns

Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

## -remarks

The resulting text layout should only be used for the intended resolution,
     and for cases where text scalability is desired <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nf-dwrite-idwritefactory-createtextlayout">CreateTextLayout</a> should be used instead.
