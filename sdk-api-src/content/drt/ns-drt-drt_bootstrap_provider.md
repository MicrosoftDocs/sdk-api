# DRT_BOOTSTRAP_PROVIDER structure


## -description


The <b>DRT_BOOTSTRAP_PROVIDER</b> structure defines the DRT interface that must be implemented by a bootstrap provider.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The DRT  infrastructure does not call the methods of the bootstrap provider concurrently.</div><div> </div>

## -struct-fields




### -field pvContext

Pointer to context data that is defined by the bootstrap resolver. When creating a bootstrap resolver, the developer  is required to populate the resolver with the required information; often times, this occurs as a "this" pointer.  This context gets passed to all the context parameters in the functions defined by the <b>DRT_BOOTSTRAP_PROVIDER</b>.


### -field Attach

Increments the count of references for the Bootstrap Provider with a set of DRTs.



#### pvContext

Contains the <b>pvContext</b> value from <b>DRT_BOOTSTRAP_PROVIDER</b>.


### -field Detach

Decrements the count of references for the Bootstrap Provider with a set of DRTs.



#### pvContext

Contains the <b>pvContext</b> value from <b>DRT_BOOTSTRAP_PROVIDER</b>.


### -field InitResolve

Called by the DRT infrastructure to supply configuration information about upcoming name resolutions.



#### pvContext

Contains the <b>pvContext</b> value from <b>DRT_BOOTSTRAP_PROVIDER</b>.



#### fSplitDetect

Specifies if the resolve operation is being utilized for network split detection and recovery.



#### timeout

Specifies the maximum time a resolve should take before timing out. This value is represented in milliseconds.



#### cMaxResults

Specifies the maximum number of results to return during the resolve operation.



#### ResolveContext

Pointer to resolver specific data.



#### fFatalError

If the bootstrap provider encounters an irrecoverable error, this parameter must be set to <b>TRUE</b> when the function complete in order for the DRT to transition to the faulted state. The <b>HRESULT</b> that is made available to the higher layer application for debugging will appear in the <b>hr</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/drt/ns-drt-drt_event_data">DRT_EVENT_DATA</a> structure associated with the event signaling the transition to the faulted state.  This bootstrap provider function should not return S_OK if setting the <i>fFatalError</i> flag to <b>TRUE</b>.


### -field IssueResolve

Called by the DRT infrastructure to issue a resolution to determine the endpoints of nodes already active in the DRT cloud.



#### pvContext

Contains the <b>pvContext</b> value from <b>DRT_BOOTSTRAP_PROVIDER</b>.



#### pvCallbackContext

Pointer to the context data that is passed back to the callback defined by the next parameter.



#### callback

A BOOTSTRAP_RESOLVE_CALLBACK that is called back for each result and DRT_E_NO_MORE.



#### ResolveContext

Pointer to resolver specific data.



#### fFatalError

If the bootstrap provider encounters an irrecoverable error, this parameter must be set to <b>TRUE</b> when the function complete in order for the DRT to transition to the faulted state. The <b>HRESULT</b> that is made available to the higher layer application for debugging will appear in the <b>hr</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/drt/ns-drt-drt_event_data">DRT_EVENT_DATA</a> structure associated with the event signaling the transition to the faulted state.  This bootstrap provider function should not return S_OK if setting the <i>fFatalError</i> flag to <b>TRUE</b>.


### -field EndResolve

Ends the resolution of an endpoint.



#### pvContext

Contains the <b>pvContext</b> value from <b>DRT_BOOTSTRAP_PROVIDER</b>.



#### ResolveContext

The <b>BOOTSTRAP_RESOLVE_CONTEXT</b> received from the Resolve function of the specified bootstrap provider.


### -field Register

Registers an endpoint with the bootstrapping mechanism. This process makes it possible for other nodes  find the endpoint via the bootstrap resolver.



#### pvContext

Contains the <b>pvContext</b> value from <b>DRT_BOOTSTRAP_PROVIDER</b>.



#### pAddressList

Pointer to the list of addresses to register with the bootstrapping mechanism.


### -field Unregister

This function deregisters an endpoint with the bootstrapping mechanism.  As a result, other nodes will be unable to find the local node via the bootstrap  resolver.



#### pvContext

Contains the <b>pvContext</b> value from <b>DRT_BOOTSTRAP_PROVIDER</b>.
