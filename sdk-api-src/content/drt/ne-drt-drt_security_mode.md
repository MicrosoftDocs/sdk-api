# DRT_SECURITY_MODE enumeration


## -description


The <b>DRT_SECURITY_MODE</b> enumeration defines possible security modes for the DRT. The security mode is specified by a field of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/drt/ns-drt-drt_settings">DRT_SETTINGS</a> structure.


## -enum-fields




### -field DRT_SECURE_RESOLVE

Nodes must authenticate the keys they publish. Nodes are not required to authenticate themselves when performing searches.


### -field DRT_SECURE_MEMBERSHIP

Nodes must authenticate the keys they publish. Nodes must also authenticate themselves when performing searches. Unauthorized nodes cannot search for  keys and cannot retrieve the data associated with published keys.


### -field DRT_SECURE_CONFIDENTIALPAYLOAD

Nodes must authenticate the keys they publish. Nodes must also authenticate themselves when performing searches. Encryption is required for all data associated with published keys prior to transmission between DRT nodes. Unauthorized nodes cannot search for keys, cannot retrieve the data associated with published keys, and cannot retrieve data by observing network traffic between other DRT nodes.


## -remarks



The more secure a DRT security mode, the more of a computational load exists for nodes participating in the DRT. More bandwidth is also consumed.
