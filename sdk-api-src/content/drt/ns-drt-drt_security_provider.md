# DRT_SECURITY_PROVIDER structure


## -description


The <b>DRT_SECURITY_PROVIDER</b> structure defines the DRT interface that must be implemented by a security provider.


## -struct-fields




### -field pvContext

This member is specified by the application when passing the <b>DRT_SECURITY_PROVIDER</b> structure to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/drt/nf-drt-drtopen">DrtOpen</a> function.

The DRT treats it as an opaque pointer, and passes it as the first parameter to the functions referenced by this structure. An application will use this as a pointer to the security provider state or to the object that implements the security provider functionality.


### -field Attach

Increments the count of references for the Security Provider with a set of DRTs.



#### pvContext

Pointer to the value held by the <b>pvContext</b> member of <b>DRT_SECURITY_PROVIDER</b>.


### -field Detach

Decrements the count of references for the Security Provider with a set of DRTs.



#### pvContext

Pointer to the value held by the <b>pvContext</b> member of <b>DRT_SECURITY_PROVIDER</b>.
