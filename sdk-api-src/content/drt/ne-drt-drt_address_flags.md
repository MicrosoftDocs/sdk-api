# DRT_ADDRESS_FLAGS enumeration


## -description

The <b>DRT_ADDRESS_FLAGS</b> enumeration defines the set of responses that may be returned by an intermediate node when performing a search for a key.

## -enum-fields

### -field DRT_ADDRESS_FLAG_ACCEPTED

The response provided by this machine was successfully used to make progress towards the search target.

### -field DRT_ADDRESS_FLAG_REJECTED

The response provided by this machine was not used in the search.  This machine may have provided the address of a node publishing a key numerically farther from the target than other nodes already contacted.

### -field DRT_ADDRESS_FLAG_UNREACHABLE

This machine did not respond.

### -field DRT_ADDRESS_FLAG_LOOP

The response provided by this machine was not used in the search.  This machine provided the address of a node that has already been contacted.

### -field DRT_ADDRESS_FLAG_TOO_BUSY

This machine indicated that it does not have sufficient resources to process the query.

### -field DRT_ADDRESS_FLAG_BAD_VALIDATE_ID

This machine is not publishing the key expected by the local DRT instance.  As a result, it may not be able to provide useful information.

### -field DRT_ADDRESS_FLAG_SUSPECT_UNREGISTERED_ID

This machine has reason to believe that the target key has been unregistered.

### -field DRT_ADDRESS_FLAG_INQUIRE

This machine was asked to provide proof of ownership of its key.
