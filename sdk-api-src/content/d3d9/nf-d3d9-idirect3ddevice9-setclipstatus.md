# IDirect3DDevice9::SetClipStatus


## -description


Sets the clip status.


## -parameters




### -param pClipStatus [in]

Type: <b>const <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d9/d3dclipstatus9">D3DCLIPSTATUS9</a>*</b>

Pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d9/d3dclipstatus9">D3DCLIPSTATUS9</a> structure, describing the clip status settings to be set. 


## -returns



Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/com/structure-of-com-error-codes">HRESULT</a></b>

If the method succeeds, the return value is D3D_OK.
 If one of the arguments is invalid, the return value is D3DERR_INVALIDCALL.




## -remarks



Clip status is used during software vertex processing. Therefore, this method is not supported on pure or nonpure hardware processing devices. For more information about pure devices, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d9/d3dcreate">D3DCREATE</a>.

When clipping is enabled during vertex processing (by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-processvertices">IDirect3DDevice9::ProcessVertices</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-drawprimitive">IDirect3DDevice9::DrawPrimitive</a>, or other drawing functions), Direct3D computes a clip code for every vertex. The clip code is a combination of D3DCS_* bits. When a vertex is outside a particular clipping plane, the corresponding bit is set in the clipping code. Direct3D maintains the clip status using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d9/d3dclipstatus9">D3DCLIPSTATUS9</a>, which has ClipUnion and ClipIntersection members. ClipUnion is a bitwise "OR" of all vertex clip codes and ClipIntersection is a bitwise "AND" of all vertex clip codes. Initial values are zero for ClipUnion and 0xFFFFFFFF for ClipIntersection. When D3DRS_CLIPPING is set to <b>FALSE</b>, ClipUnion and ClipIntersection are set to zero. Direct3D updates the clip status during drawing calls. To compute clip status for a particular object, set ClipUnion and ClipIntersection to their initial value and continue drawing.

Clip status is not updated by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-drawrectpatch">IDirect3DDevice9::DrawRectPatch</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-drawtripatch">IDirect3DDevice9::DrawTriPatch</a> because there is no software emulation for them.
