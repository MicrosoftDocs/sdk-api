# IDirect3DDevice9Ex::CheckDeviceState


## -description


Reports the current cooperative-level status of the Direct3D device for a windowed or full-screen application.


## -parameters




### -param hDestinationWindow [in]

Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">HWND</a></b>

The destination window handle to check for occlusion. When this parameter is <b>NULL</b>, S_PRESENT_OCCLUDED is returned when another device has fullscreen ownership. When the window handle is not <b>NULL</b>, window's client area is checked for occlusion. A window is occluded if any part of it is obscured by another application.


## -returns



Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/com/structure-of-com-error-codes">HRESULT</a></b>

Possible return values include: D3D_OK, D3DERR_DEVICELOST, D3DERR_DEVICEHUNG, D3DERR_DEVICEREMOVED, or D3DERR_OUTOFVIDEOMEMORY (see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d9/d3derr">D3DERR</a>), or S_PRESENT_MODE_CHANGED, or S_PRESENT_OCCLUDED (see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d9/device-state-return-codes">S_PRESENT</a>).




## -remarks



This method replaces <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-testcooperativelevel">IDirect3DDevice9::TestCooperativeLevel</a>, which always returns S_OK in Direct3D 9Ex applications.

We recommend not to call <b>CheckDeviceState</b> every frame. Instead, call <b>CheckDeviceState</b> only if the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9ex-presentex">IDirect3DDevice9Ex::PresentEx</a> method returns a failure code.

See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d9/dx9lh">Lost Device Behavior Changes</a> for more information about lost, hung, and removed devices.
