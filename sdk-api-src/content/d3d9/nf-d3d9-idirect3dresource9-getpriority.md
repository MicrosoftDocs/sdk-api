# IDirect3DResource9::GetPriority


## -description

Retrieves the priority for this resource.

## -parameters

## -returns

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">DWORD</a></b>

Returns a DWORD value, indicating the priority of the resource.

## -remarks

<b>IDirect3DResource9::GetPriority</b> is used for priority control of managed resources. This method returns 0 on nonmanaged resources.

Priorities are used to determine when managed resources are to be removed from memory. A resource assigned a low priority is removed before a resource with a high priority. If two resources have the same priority, the resource that was used more recently is kept in memory; the other resource is removed. Managed resources have a default priority of 0.
