# IDirect3DDevice9::SetVertexDeclaration


## -description

Sets a <a href="/windows/desktop/direct3d9/vertex-declaration">Vertex Declaration (Direct3D 9)</a>.

## -parameters

### -param pDecl [in]

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d9helper/nn-d3d9helper-idirect3dvertexdeclaration9">IDirect3DVertexDeclaration9</a>*</b>

Pointer to an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d9helper/nn-d3d9helper-idirect3dvertexdeclaration9">IDirect3DVertexDeclaration9</a> object, which contains the vertex declaration.

## -returns

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/com/structure-of-com-error-codes">HRESULT</a></b>

If the method succeeds, the return value is D3D_OK.
 The return value can be D3DERR_INVALIDCALL.

## -remarks

A vertex declaration is an IDirect3DVertexDeclaration9 object that defines the data members of a vertex (i.e. texture coordinates, colors, normals, etc.). This data can be useful for implementing <a href="/windows/desktop/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-pguide">vertex shaders and pixel shaders</a>.
