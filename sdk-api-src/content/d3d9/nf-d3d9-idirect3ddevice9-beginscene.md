# IDirect3DDevice9::BeginScene


## -description


Begins a scene. 


## -parameters






## -returns



Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/com/structure-of-com-error-codes">HRESULT</a></b>

If the method succeeds, the return value is D3D_OK. The method will fail with D3DERR_INVALIDCALL if <b>IDirect3DDevice9::BeginScene</b> is called 
      while already in a <b>IDirect3DDevice9::BeginScene</b>/<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-endscene">IDirect3DDevice9::EndScene</a> pair. This happens only 
      when <b>IDirect3DDevice9::BeginScene</b> is called twice without first calling <b>IDirect3DDevice9::EndScene</b>.




## -remarks



Applications must call <b>IDirect3DDevice9::BeginScene</b> before performing any rendering and must call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-endscene">IDirect3DDevice9::EndScene</a> 
      when rendering is complete and before calling <b>IDirect3DDevice9::BeginScene</b> again.

If <b>IDirect3DDevice9::BeginScene</b> fails, the device was unable to begin the scene, and there is no need to 
      call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-endscene">IDirect3DDevice9::EndScene</a>. In fact, calls to <b>IDirect3DDevice9::EndScene</b> will fail if the 
      previous <b>IDirect3DDevice9::BeginScene</b> failed. This applies to any application that creates multiple swap chains.

There should be one <b>IDirect3DDevice9::BeginScene</b>/<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-endscene">IDirect3DDevice9::EndScene</a> pair between any successive calls to 
      present (either <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-present">IDirect3DDevice9::Present</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3dswapchain9-present">IDirect3DSwapChain9::Present</a>). <b>IDirect3DDevice9::BeginScene</b> should 
      be called once before any rendering is performed, and <b>IDirect3DDevice9::EndScene</b> should be called once after all rendering for a frame has been
      submitted to the runtime. Multiple non-nested <b>IDirect3DDevice9::BeginScene</b>/<b>IDirect3DDevice9::EndScene</b> pairs between calls to present
      are legal, but having more than one pair may incur a performance hit.
      To enable maximal parallelism between the CPU and the graphics accelerator, it is advantageous to 
      call <b>IDirect3DDevice9::EndScene</b> as far ahead of calling present as possible.
