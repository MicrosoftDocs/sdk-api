## -description

Used to register a discoverable service on this device.

## -parameters

### -param pRequest

A pointer to a [DNS_SERVICE_REGISTER_REQUEST](ns-windns-dns_service_register_request.md) structure that contains information about the service to be registered.

### -param pCancel

An optional (it can be `nullptr`) pointer to a [DNS_SERVICE_CANCEL](ns-windns-dns_service_cancel.md) structure that can be used to cancel a pending asynchronous registration operation. If not `nullptr`, then this handle must remain valid until the registration is canceled.

## -returns

If successful, returns **DNS_REQUEST_PENDING**; otherwise, returns the appropriate DNS-specific error code as defined in `Winerror.h`. For extended error information, call [GetLastError](/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror).

## -remarks

This function is asynchronous. The registration callback will be called once the registration succeeds. To deregister the service, call [DnsServiceDeRegister](nf-windns-dnsservicederegister.md).
 
The registration is tied to the lifetime of the calling process. If the process goes away, the service will be automatically deregistered.
