# DnsRecordListFree macro


## -description


The 
<b>DnsRecordListFree</b> function frees memory allocated for DNS records obtained using the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/windns/nf-windns-dnsquery_a">DnsQuery</a> function.


## -parameters




### -param p [in, out, optional]

A pointer to a <a href="/windows/win32/api/windns/ns-windns-dns_recorda">DNS_RECORD</a> structure that contains the list of DNS records to be freed.


### -param t [in]

A specifier of how the record list should be freed. The only type currently supported is a deep freeing of the entire record list. For more information and a list of values, see the <a href="/windows/win32/api/windns/ne-windns-dns_free_type">DNS_FREE_TYPE</a> enumeration.


## -remarks



The 
<b>DnsRecordListFree</b> function can be used to free memory allocated from query results obtained using a 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/windns/nf-windns-dnsquery_a">DnsQuery</a> function call; it cannot free memory allocated for DNS record lists created manually.
