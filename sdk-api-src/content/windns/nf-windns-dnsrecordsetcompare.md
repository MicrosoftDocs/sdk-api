# DnsRecordSetCompare function


## -description

The 
<b>DnsRecordSetCompare</b> function compares two RR sets.

## -parameters

### -param pRR1 [in, out]

A pointer to a <a href="/windows/win32/api/windns/ns-windns-dns_recorda">DNS_RECORD</a> structure that contains the first DNS RR set of the comparison pair.

### -param pRR2 [in, out]

A pointer to a <a href="/windows/win32/api/windns/ns-windns-dns_recorda">DNS_RECORD</a> structure that contains the second DNS resource record set of the comparison pair.

### -param ppDiff1 [out, optional]

A pointer to a <a href="/windows/win32/api/windns/ns-windns-dns_recorda">DNS_RECORD</a> pointer that contains the list of resource records built as a result of the arithmetic performed on them: <b>pRRSet1</b> minus <b>pRRSet2</b>.

### -param ppDiff2 [out, optional]

A pointer to a <a href="/windows/win32/api/windns/ns-windns-dns_recorda">DNS_RECORD</a> pointer that contains the list of resource records built as a result of the arithmetic performed on them: <b>pRRSet2</b> minus <b>pRRSet1</b>.

## -returns

Returns <b>TRUE</b> if the compared record sets are equivalent, <b>FALSE</b> if they are not.

## -remarks

When comparing record sets, DNS resource records that are stored using different character encoding are treated by the 
<b>DnsRecordSetCompare</b> function as equivalent. Contrast this to the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/windns/nf-windns-dnsrecordcompare">DnsRecordCompare</a> function, in which equivalent records with different encoding are not returned as equivalent records.
