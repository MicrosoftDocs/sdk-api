## -description

Used to remove a registered service.

## -parameters

### -param pRequest

A pointer to the [DNS_SERVICE_REGISTER_REQUEST](ns-windns-dns_service_register_request.md) structure that was used to register the service.

### -param pCancel

Must be `nullptr`.

## -returns

If successful, returns **DNS_REQUEST_PENDING**; otherwise, returns the appropriate DNS-specific error code as defined in `Winerror.h`. For extended error information, call [GetLastError](/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror).

## -remarks

This function is asynchronous. The callback will be invoked when the deregistration is completed, with a copy of the [DNS_SERVICE_INSTANCE](ns-windns-dns_service_instance.md) structure that was passed to [DnsServiceRegister](nf-windns-dnsserviceregister.md) when the service was registered.
