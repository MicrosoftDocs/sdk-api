## -description

Provides members you can use to attach a [DesktopWindowXamlSource](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.hosting.desktopwindowxamlsource) object that hosts a WinRT XAML control to a parent UI element in your desktop app.

## -remarks

This interface is implemented by the [DesktopWindowXamlSource](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.hosting.desktopwindowxamlsource) class. **DesktopWindowXamlSource** is a key component the [WinRT XAML hosting API](/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/using-the-xaml-hosting-api), which desktop apps can use to host WinRT XAML controls in any UI element that is associated with a window handle (this feature is also called *XAML Islands*).
