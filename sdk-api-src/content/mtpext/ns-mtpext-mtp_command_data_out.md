# MTP_COMMAND_DATA_OUT structure


## -description



The <b>MTP_COMMAND_DATA_OUT</b> structure contains Media Transport Protocol (MTP) responses that are filled by the device driver on exiting a call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mswmdm/nf-mswmdm-iwmdmdevice3-deviceiocontrol">IWMDMDevice3::DeviceIoControl</a>.




## -struct-fields




### -field ResponseCode

Response code.


### -field NumParams

Number of parameters for this response.


### -field Params

Parameters of the response. <b>MTP_RESPONSE_MAX_PARAMS</b> is a defined constant with a value of 5.


### -field CommandReadDataSize

Data size of <b>CommandReadData</b>[1], in bytes.


### -field CommandReadData

 




#### - CommandReadData[1]

Optional, first byte of data to read from the device if <b>MTP_COMMAND_DATA_IN.NextPhase</b> is MTP_NEXTPHASE_READ_DATA.


## -remarks



The input buffer is expected to contain an appropriately filled out <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mtpext/ns-mtpext-mtp_command_data_in">MTP_COMMAND_DATA_IN</a> structure. On exit, the device driver will fill out the <b>MTP_COMMAND_DATA_OUT</b> structure and save it to the output buffer. Therefore, any request must have an input buffer of at least SIZEOF_REQUIRED_COMMAND_DATA_IN bytes, which is defined as the following:

<pre class="syntax" xml:space="preserve"><code>
#define SIZEOF_REQUIRED_COMMAND_DATA_IN (sizeof(MTP_COMMAND_DATA_IN)-1)
</code></pre>
Any request must also have an output buffer of at least SIZEOF_REQUIRED_COMMAND_DATA_OUT bytes, which is defined as the following:

<pre class="syntax" xml:space="preserve"><code>
#define SIZEOF_REQUIRED_COMMAND_DATA_OUT (sizeof(MTP_COMMAND_DATA_OUT)-1)
</code></pre>
It is assumed that all commands are self-contained, that is, they can be processed completely in one call. This has implications on lengthy data transfers, because chunking in the traditional sense is not supported. (For example, to issue a read for 3megabytes, the caller would have to ensure that it allocates an output buffer of 3 MB plus <b>SIZEOF_REQUIRED_COMMAND_DATA_OUT</b> bytes.) Lengthy data transfers should not be done with this method, but rather through normal data transfer APIs.
