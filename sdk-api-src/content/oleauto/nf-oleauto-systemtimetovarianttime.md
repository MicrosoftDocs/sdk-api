# SystemTimeToVariantTime function


## -description


Converts a system time to a variant representation.


## -parameters




### -param lpSystemTime [in]

The system time.


### -param pvtime [out]

The variant time.


## -returns



The function returns TRUE on success and FALSE otherwise.




## -remarks



A variant time is stored as an 8-byte real value (<b>double</b>), representing a date between January 1, 100 and December 31, 9999, inclusive. The value 2.0 represents January 1, 1900; 3.0 represents January 2, 1900, and so on. Adding 1 to the value increments the date by a day. The fractional part of the value represents the time of day. Therefore, 2.5 represents noon on January 1, 1900; 3.25 represents 6:00 A.M. on January 2, 1900, and so on. Negative numbers represent dates prior to December 30, 1899.

The variant time resolves to one second. Any milliseconds in the input date are ignored. 

> [!NOTE]
> When working with variant time, be mindful of the additional day added in leap years, which might produce unexpected results if unhandled. For more information, see [leap year readiness](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-developer-community-blog/it-s-2020-is-your-code-ready-for-leap-day/ba-p/1157279).

The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-systemtime">SYSTEMTIME</a> structure is useful for the following reasons:  

<ul>
<li>
It spans all time/date periods. MS-DOS date/time is limited to representing only those dates between 1/1/1980 and 12/31/2107. 

</li>
<li>
The date/time elements are all easily accessible without needing to do any bit decoding.

</li>
<li>
The National Data Support data and time formatting functions <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/datetimeapi/nf-datetimeapi-getdateformata">GetDateFormat</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/datetimeapi/nf-datetimeapi-gettimeformata">GetTimeFormat</a> take an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-systemtime">LPSYSTEMTIME</a> value as input.

</li>
<li>
It is the default time/date data format supported by Windows.

</li>
</ul>
The <b>SystemTimeToVariantTime</b> function will accept invalid dates and try to fix them when resolving to a VARIANT time. For example, an invalid date such as 2/29/2001 will resolve to 3/1/2001. Only days are fixed, so invalid month values result in an error being returned. Days are checked to be between 1 and 31. Negative days and days greater than 31 results in an error. A day less than 31 but greater than the maximum day in that month has the day promoted to the appropriate day of the next month. A day equal to zero resolves as the last day of the previous month. For example, an invalid dates such as 2/0/2001 will resolve to 1/31/2001.
