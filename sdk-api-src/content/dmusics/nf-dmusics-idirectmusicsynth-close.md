## -description

The <code>Close</code> method closes a DirectMusic "port", which is a DirectMusic term for a device that sends or receives music data.



## -returns

<code>Close</code> returns S_OK if the call was successful. Otherwise, the method returns an appropriate error code. The following table shows some of the possible return status codes.

## -remarks

This method closes a DirectMusic "port" that was previously opened by a call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/dmusics/nf-dmusics-idirectmusicsynth-open">IDirectMusicSynth::Open</a>.

When the DirectMusic "port" closes, it automatically releases all instruments and waves that were previously downloaded to the port. However, a good practice for applications is to explicitly free these objects before closing the port.

Avoid confusing the term DirectMusic "port" with a DMus port driver. A DirectMusic port corresponds to a render or capture pin on a DirectMusic filter. For more information about DirectMusic ports, see the description of the <b>IDirectMusicPort</b> interface in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.
