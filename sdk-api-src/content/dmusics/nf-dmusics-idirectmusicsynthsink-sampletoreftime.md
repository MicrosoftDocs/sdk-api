# IDirectMusicSynthSink::SampleToRefTime


## -description

The <code>SampleToRefTime</code> method converts a sample time to a reference time.

## -parameters

### -param llSampleTime

Specifies the sample time. For more information, see the following Remarks section.

### -param prfTime

Output pointer for the reference time. This parameter points to a caller-allocated REFERENCE_TIME variable into which the method writes the reference time.

## -returns

<code>SampleToRefTime</code> returns S_OK if the call is successful. Otherwise, the method returns an appropriate error code.

## -remarks

The <code>SampleToRefTime</code> method converts sample time to reference time. Sample time is expressed as the number of samples rendered, and reference time is measured in 100-nanosecond units.

The synth sink manages the timing relationship between the master clock (set with a call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/dmusics/nf-dmusics-idirectmusicsynthsink-setmasterclock">IDirectMusicSynthSink::SetMasterClock</a>) and the audio stream.

For more information, see the description of reference time and sample time in <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/synthesizer-timing">Synthesizer Timing</a>.
