# IDirectMusicSynth::SetNumChannelGroups


## -description

The <code>SetNumChannelGroups</code> method instructs the synthesizer to set its number of channel groups to a new value.

## -parameters

### -param dwGroups

Specifies the number of channel groups requested.

## -returns

<code>SetNumChannelGroups</code> returns S_OK if the call was successful. Otherwise, the method returns an appropriate error code. The following table shows some of the possible return status codes.

<table>

<td width="60%">
Indicates that the synth is not open or not properly configured.

<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_FAIL</b></dt>

</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates that the method is unable to allocate the channel groups.

## -remarks

Even though <a href="/windows/desktop/api/dmusics/nf-dmusics-idirectmusicsynth-open">IDirectMusicSynth::Open</a> tells the DirectMusic "port" how many channel groups to create, the application might later need to dynamically increase or reduce that number with a call to <code>SetNumChannelGroups</code>.

Each channel group supports a set of 16 MIDI channels. For example, if <i>dwChannelGroups</i> is set to three, the synthesizer creates 48 channels.

For more information, see the description of the <b>IDirectMusic</b> interface in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.
