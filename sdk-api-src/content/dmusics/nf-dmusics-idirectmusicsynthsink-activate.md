## -remarks



The synthesizer itself can be told to enable or disable the audio device. In turn, it calls the synth sink, which manages the audio device. This gives the application the ability to manage its use of resources. When it is not playing music, it can deactivate the sink to free the wave-output device for other applications.

For more information, see the description of the <b>IDirectMusic</b> interface in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.
