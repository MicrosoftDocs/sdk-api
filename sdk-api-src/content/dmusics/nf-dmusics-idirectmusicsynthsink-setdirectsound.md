# IDirectMusicSynthSink::SetDirectSound


## -description


The <code>SetDirectSound</code> method connects the synthesizer sink with an existing DirectSound object and a DirectSound buffer.


## -parameters




### -param pDirectSound

Pointer to an <b>IDirectSound</b> object that the sink is to be associated with. This parameter is set to a valid, non-<b>NULL</b> pointer value.


### -param pDirectSoundBuffer

Pointer to the <b>IDirectSoundBuffer</b> object that the sink is to be associated with. This parameter can be <b>NULL</b>. For more information, see the following Remarks section.


## -returns



<code>SetDirectSound</code> returns S_OK if the call was successful. Otherwise, the method returns an appropriate error code. The following table shows some of the possible return status codes.

## -remarks



The <i>pDirectSound</i> parameter points to an <b>IDirectSound</b> instance that is received from <code>IDirectMusicPort::SetDirectSound</code> and is non-<b>NULL</b>.

If <i>pDirectSoundBuffer</i> is <b>NULL</b>, the primary buffer for <b>IDirectSound</b> will be upgraded, if necessary, to support the sample rate and channel information for the sink (obtained from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dmusics/nf-dmusics-idirectmusicsynth-getformat">IDirectMusicSynth::GetFormat</a>).

The <b>IDirectSoundBuffer</b> should be a secondary streaming buffer with a format that matches the format obtained from the synthesizer. If <i>pDirectSoundBuffer</i> is <b>NULL</b>, then an appropriate <b>IDirectSoundBuffer</b> instance will be created internally.

Neither the <b>IDirectSound</b> nor the <b>IDirectSoundBuffer</b> instance can be changed once the sink has been activated.

The <i>pDirectSound</i> and <i>pDirectSoundBuffer</i> parameters follow the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/reference-counting-conventions-for-com-objects">reference-counting conventions for COM objects</a>.

For more information, see the description of the <b>IDirectSound</b>, <b>IDirectSoundBuffer</b>, and <b>IDirectMusicPort</b> interfaces in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.
