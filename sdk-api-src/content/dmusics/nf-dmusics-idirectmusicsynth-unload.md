# IDirectMusicSynth::Unload


## -description


The <code>Unload</code> method unloads a DLS resource (waveform or articulation data for a MIDI instrument) that was previously downloaded by a call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dmusics/nf-dmusics-idirectmusicsynth-download">IDirectMusicSynth::Download</a>.


## -parameters




### -param hDownload

Handle to the DLS resource, which was obtained from a previous call to the <b>IDirectMusicSynth::Download</b> method. If the <i>lpFreeHandle</i> parameter below is non-<b>NULL</b>, the synthesizer passes this handle as the first parameter to the <i>lpFreeHandle</i> callback routine.


### -param lpFreeHandle

Pointer to a callback routine that will be called when the memory containing the DLS resource is no longer in use. If the original call to <b>IDirectMusicSynth::Download</b> returned <b>FALSE</b> in <i>pbFree</i>, this means that the synthesizer continued accessing the caller-allocated memory in the download chunk after the return from <b>Download</b>. If so, the synthesizer notifies the caller as soon as the memory can be freed, but this might occur later than the return from <code>Unload</code> because the DLS resource might be currently in use. The callback function takes two handles as call parameters. The first of these two handles is the <i>hDownload</i> parameter (see above), and the second is the <i>hUserData</i> parameter (see below).


### -param hUserData

Pointer to user data, which is passed as the second parameter to the <i>lpFreeHandle</i> callback function above. The meaning of this value is known only to the caller, but it is typically a pointer to context information describing the state of the memory that is to be freed.


## -returns



<code>Unload</code> returns S_OK if the call was successful. Otherwise, the method returns an appropriate error code. The following table shows some of the possible return status codes.

## -remarks



When the caller downloads a DLS resource to the synthesizer by calling <b>IDirectMusicSynth::Download</b>, the synthesizer has the option of either making its own copy of the DLS resource or continuing to use the caller's copy of the DLS resource. The <b>Download</b> method specifies one of these options by the value that it outputs through its <i>pbFree</i> parameter:

<ul>
<li>
*<i>pbFree</i>=<b>TRUE</b> if the synthesizer makes its own copy. In this case, the caller can free the DLS memory on return from <b>Download</b>. Also, the caller can specify the values for the <code>Unload</code> method's <i>lpFreeHandle</i> and <i>hUserData</i> parameters as <b>NULL</b>.

</li>
<li>
*<i>pbFree</i>=<b>FALSE</b> if the synthesizer keeps a pointer to the caller's copy. In this case, the caller must maintain its allocation of the memory containing the DLS resource until the synthesizer has finished using that memory.

</li>
</ul>
In the latter case, the caller must not release the memory for the DLS resource immediately on return from the <code>Unload</code> call because the synthesizer might still be in the process of rendering a note that uses the DLS resource. Instead, the caller must wait for the synthesizer to call the <i>lpFreeHandle</i> callback routine, which the synthesizer will do as soon as the note finishes and the memory is no longer needed.

For more information, see the descriptions of the <b>IDirectMusic</b> and <b>IDirectMusicPort</b> interfaces and the <b>IDirectMusicPort::UnloadInstrument</b> method in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.
