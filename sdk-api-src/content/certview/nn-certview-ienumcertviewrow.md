# IEnumCERTVIEWROW interface


## -description

The <b>IEnumCERTVIEWROW</b> interface represents a row-enumeration sequence that contains the data in the rows of the Certificate Services view, allowing further access to the columns, attributes, and extensions associated with each row.

The row-enumeration sequence is obtained through a call to the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/certview/nf-certview-icertview-openview">ICertView::OpenView</a> method. After this enumeration sequence is obtained, the <b>IEnumCERTVIEWROW</b> methods can be used to perform the following tasks:<ul>
<li>Navigate through the enumeration sequence.</li>
<li>Obtain other objects for enumerating the columns, certificate extensions, or attributes associated with a specific row.</li>
<li>Retrieve the maximum number of rows for the view.</li>
</ul>


<b>IEnumCERTVIEWROW</b> is defined in Certview.h. When you create your program, however, use Certsrv.h as the include file. Certadm.dll provides the <b>IEnumCERTVIEWROW</b> interface. The type information for this interface is also in Certadml.dll, which is shipped with the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK).

Certificate Services interfaces support both apartment-threading and free-threading models. For better throughput, free threading is recommended.

## -inheritance

The <b>IEnumCERTVIEWROW</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oaidl/nn-oaidl-idispatch">IDispatch</a> interface. <b>IEnumCERTVIEWROW</b> also has these types of members:
