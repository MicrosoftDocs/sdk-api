# ICertView interface


## -description

The <b>ICertView</b> interface allows properly authorized clients to create a customized or complete view of the Certificate Services database.

The <b>ICertView</b> interface is used to perform the following tasks:<ul>
<li>Establish a connection with a Certificate Services server.</li>
<li>Obtain a row-enumeration sequence of the rows in the Certificate Services database.</li>
<li>Obtain a column-enumeration sequence for the columns of a row in the Certificate Services database.</li>
<li>Get the column count and index.</li>
<li>Specify sorting and qualifying restrictions for a column.</li>
<li>Specify the number of columns and a specific column in a customized view.</li>
</ul>


In C++, the <b>ICertView</b> interface is instantiated through a call to the COM function <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cocreateinstance">CoCreateInstance</a>. If, on the other hand, you are using Visual Basic Scripting Edition, you will need to reference the CertAdm Type library in your project and then instantiate the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/certview/nn-certview-icertview2">CCertView</a> object  by a call to 'New'. The sample code for the  
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/certview/nf-certview-icertview-openconnection">ICertView::OpenConnection</a> method illustrates the instantiation techniques.

The <b>ICertView</b> interface is defined in Certview.h. When you create your program, however, use Certsrv.h as the include file. Certadm.dll provides the <b>ICertView</b> interface. The type information for this interface is also in Certadml.dll, which is shipped with the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK).

Certificate Services interfaces support both apartment-threading and free-threading models. For better throughput, free threading is recommended.

## -inheritance

The <b>ICertView</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oaidl/nn-oaidl-idispatch">IDispatch</a> interface. <b>ICertView</b> also has these types of members:
