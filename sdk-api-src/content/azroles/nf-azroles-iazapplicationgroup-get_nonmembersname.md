# IAzApplicationGroup::get_NonMembersName


## -description


The <b>NonMembersName</b> property retrieves the account names of  accounts that are refused membership in  the application group.

This property is read-only.


## -parameters


## -remarks



The application group will never have an  account specified by this property as a member, even if that account is specified directly or indirectly by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/azroles/nf-azroles-iazapplicationgroup-get_members">Members</a> property.

Denying membership to an account in an application group does not prevent that account from being assigned to a role through a different application group, nor from being granted permission to a resource through assignment to any other role.

This property is ignored unless the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/azroles/nf-azroles-iazapplicationgroup-get_type">Type</a> property is AZ_GROUPTYPE_BASIC.

In JScript, the returned <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/oaidl/ns-oaidl-safearray">SAFEARRAY</a> must be converted to the JScript <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/scripting/javascript/reference/array-object-javascript">Array</a> object.
