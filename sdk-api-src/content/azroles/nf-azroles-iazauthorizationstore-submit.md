# IAzAuthorizationStore::Submit


## -description


The <b>Submit</b> method persists changes made to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/azroles/nn-azroles-iazauthorizationstore">AzAuthorizationStore</a> object.


## -parameters




### -param lFlags [in]

Flags that modify the behavior of the <b>Submit</b> method. The default value is zero. If the AZ_SUBMIT_FLAG_ABORT flag is specified, the changes to the object are discarded and the object is updated to match the underlying policy store.


### -param varReserved [in, optional]

Reserved for future use.


## -remarks



Any additions or modifications to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/azroles/nn-azroles-iazauthorizationstore">AzAuthorizationStore</a> object are not persisted until the <b>Submit</b> method is called. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/azroles/nf-azroles-iazauthorizationstore-delete">Delete</a>  method automatically submits changes.

The <b>Submit</b> method does not extend to child objects; child objects  must be individually persisted to the policy store. A created <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/azroles/nn-azroles-iazauthorizationstore">AzAuthorizationStore</a> object must be submitted before it can be referenced or become a parent object. The destructor for an object silently discards unsubmitted changes.
