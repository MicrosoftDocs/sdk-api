# IAzAuthorizationStore::Delete


## -description


The <b>Delete</b> method deletes the policy store currently in use by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/azroles/nn-azroles-iazauthorizationstore">AzAuthorizationStore</a> object.


## -parameters




### -param varReserved [in, optional]

Reserved for future use.


## -remarks



When the <b>Delete</b> method is called, the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/azroles/nn-azroles-iazauthorizationstore">AzAuthorizationStore</a> object returns to an uninitialized state. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/azroles/nf-azroles-iazauthorizationstore-initialize">Initialize</a> method can then be called to reinitialize the object. 

<div class="alert"><b>Important</b>  All objects opened by clients on the policy store  (for example,  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/azroles/nn-azroles-iazapplication">IAzApplication</a> objects created using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/azroles/nf-azroles-iazauthorizationstore-createapplication">CreateApplication</a>) must be released before you call the <b>Delete</b> method. If the <b>Delete</b> method is called on an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/azroles/nn-azroles-iazauthorizationstore">AzAuthorizationStore</a> object whose current policy store contains child objects, HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_SERVER_HAS_OPEN_HANDLES) is returned.</div>
