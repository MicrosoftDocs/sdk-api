# IAzApplication::DeleteScope


## -description


The <b>DeleteScope</b> method removes the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/azroles/nn-azroles-iazscope">IAzScope</a> object with the specified name from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/azroles/nn-azroles-iazapplication">IAzApplication</a> object.


## -parameters




### -param bstrScopeName [in]

Name of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/azroles/nn-azroles-iazscope">IAzScope</a> object to delete.


### -param varReserved [in, optional]

Reserved for future use.


## -remarks



If there are any <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/azroles/nn-azroles-iazscope">IAzScope</a> references to an <b>IAzScope</b> object that has been deleted from the cache, the <b>IAzScope</b> object can no longer be used. In C++, you must release references to deleted <b>IAzScope</b> objects by calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-release">IUnknown::Release</a> method. In Visual Basic, references to deleted objects are automatically released.
