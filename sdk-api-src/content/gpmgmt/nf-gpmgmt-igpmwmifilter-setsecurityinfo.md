## -remarks



You should understand these considerations before changing permissions on WMI filters.

<ul>
<li>Read permission is required for all users to whom a WMI filter applies. Authenticated users always have read access to all WMI filters. Typically, all users to whom the GPO with the WMI filter link applies also have read access.</li>
<li>Users with permission to edit WMI filters can affect policy processing for all users to whom the WMI filter applies.</li>
</ul>
