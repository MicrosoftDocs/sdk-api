# IISDB_SDTT interface


## -description

Implements methods that get data
  from an Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting (ISDB)  software download
  trigger table
  (SDTT). An SDTT contains download information such as service ID, schedule, and
  receiver types for revision.

To obtain a pointer to this interface, first make sure that the media graph is in a running state and that the stream you are tuned to contains an SDTT. Then:

<ol>
<li>Query the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/mstv/bda-mpeg-2-transport-information-filter">BDA MPEG-2 Transport Information Filter</a> to obtain a pointer to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mpeg2psiparser/nn-mpeg2psiparser-ipsitables">IPSITables</a> interface. (You can also go through the graph and query each filter until you find one that supports <b>IPSITables</b>.)</li>
<li>Call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mpeg2psiparser/nf-mpeg2psiparser-ipsitables-gettable">IPSITables::GetTable</a> method. The interface pointer for the desired table is returned in the <i>ppIUnknown</i> output parameter.
</li>
</ol>
