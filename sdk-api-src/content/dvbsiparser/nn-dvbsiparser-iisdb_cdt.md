# IISDB_CDT interface


## -description

Implements methods that get information from an Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting (ISDB)  common data table (CDT). A CDT contains data, such as company logos, that is needed for receivers and stored in
  nonvolatile memory.


To obtain a pointer to this interface, first make sure that the media graph is in a running state and that the stream you are tuned to contains a CDT. Then:

<ol>
<li>Query the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/mstv/bda-mpeg-2-transport-information-filter">BDA MPEG-2 Transport Information Filter</a> to obtain a pointer to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mpeg2psiparser/nn-mpeg2psiparser-ipsitables">IPSITables</a> interface. (You can also go through the graph and query each filter until you find one that supports <b>IPSITables</b>.)</li>
<li>Call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mpeg2psiparser/nf-mpeg2psiparser-ipsitables-gettable">IPSITables::GetTable</a> method. The interface pointer for the desired table is returned in the <i>ppIUnknown</i> output parameter.
</li>
</ol>

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IISDB_CDT</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IISDB_CDT</b> also has these types of members:
