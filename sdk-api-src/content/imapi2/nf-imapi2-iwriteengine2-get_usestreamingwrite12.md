## -description


Retrieves a value that indicates if the write operations use the WRITE12 or WRITE10 command.


## -parameters




### -param value [out]

If VARIANT_TRUE, the write operations use the WRITE12 command with the streaming bit set to one. Otherwise, if VARIANT_FALSE, the write operations use the WRITE10 command.


## -returns



S_OK is returned on success, but other success codes may be returned as a result of implementation. The following error codes are commonly returned on operation failure, but do not represent the only possible error values:
