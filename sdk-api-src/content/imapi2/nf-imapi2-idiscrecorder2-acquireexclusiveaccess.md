# IDiscRecorder2::AcquireExclusiveAccess


## -description


Acquires exclusive access to the device.


## -parameters




### -param force [in]

Set to VARIANT_TRUE to gain exclusive access to the volume whether the file system volume can or cannot be dismounted. If VARIANT_FALSE, this method  gains exclusive access only when there is no file system mounted on the volume.


### -param __MIDL__IDiscRecorder20000 [in]

String that contains the friendly name of the client application requesting exclusive access. Cannot be <b>NULL</b> or a zero-length string. The string must conform to the restrictions for the IOCTL_CDROM_EXCLUSIVE_ACCESS control code found in the DDK.


## -returns



S_OK is returned on success, but other success codes may be returned as a result of implementation. The following error codes are commonly returned on operation failure, but do not represent the only possible error values:

## -remarks



You should not have to call this method to acquire the lock yourself because the write operations, such as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/imapi2/nf-imapi2-idiscformat2data-write">IDiscFormat2Data::Write</a>, acquires the lock for you.

Each recorder has a lock count. The first call to a recorder locks the device for exclusive access. Applications can use the <b>AcquireExclusiveAccess</b> method multiple times to apply multiple locks on a device. Each call increments the lock count by one. 

When unlocking a recorder, the lock count must reach zero to free the device for other clients. Calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/imapi2/nf-imapi2-idiscrecorder2-releaseexclusiveaccess">IDiscRecorder2::ReleaseExclusiveAccess</a> method decrements the lock count by one.

An equal number of calls to the  <b>AcquireExclusiveAccess</b> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/imapi2/nf-imapi2-idiscrecorder2-releaseexclusiveaccess">ReleaseExclusiveAccess</a> methods are needed to free a device. Should the application exit unexpectedly or crash while holding the exclusive access, the CDROM.SYS driver will automatically release these exclusive locks.

If the device is already locked, you can call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/imapi2/nf-imapi2-idiscrecorder2-get_exclusiveaccessowner">IDiscRecorder2::get_ExclusiveAccessOwner</a> to retrieve the name of the client application that currently has exclusive access.
