# IMAPI_READ_TRACK_ADDRESS_TYPE enumeration


## -description

Defines values that indicate how to interpret track addresses for the current disc profile of a randomly-writable, hardware-defect-managed media type.

## -enum-fields

### -field IMAPI_READ_TRACK_ADDRESS_TYPE_LBA

Interpret the address field as an LBA (sector address).  The returned data should reflect the information for the track which contains the specified LBA.

### -field IMAPI_READ_TRACK_ADDRESS_TYPE_TRACK

Interpret the address field as a track number.  The returned data should reflect the information for the specified track.  This version of the command has the greatest compatibility with legacy devices.

### -field IMAPI_READ_TRACK_ADDRESS_TYPE_SESSION

Interpret the address field as a session number.  The returned data should reflect the information for the first track which exists in the specified session.  Note that not all drives support this method.
