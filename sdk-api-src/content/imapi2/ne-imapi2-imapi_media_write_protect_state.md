# IMAPI_MEDIA_WRITE_PROTECT_STATE enumeration


## -description

Defines values that indicate the media write protect status.   One or more write protect values can be set on a given drive.

## -enum-fields

### -field IMAPI_WRITEPROTECTED_UNTIL_POWERDOWN

  Power to the drive needs to be cycled before allowing writes to the media.

### -field IMAPI_WRITEPROTECTED_BY_CARTRIDGE

The media is in a cartridge with the write protect tab set.

### -field IMAPI_WRITEPROTECTED_BY_MEDIA_SPECIFIC_REASON

The drive is disallowing writes for a media-specific reason. For example:  <ul>
<li>The media was originally in a cartridge and was set to disallow writes when the media is not in a cartridge.</li>
<li>The media has used all available spare areas for defect management and is preventing writes to protect the existing data.</li>
</ul>

### -field IMAPI_WRITEPROTECTED_BY_SOFTWARE_WRITE_PROTECT

A write-protect flag on the media is set. Various media types, such as DVD-RAM and DVD-RW, support a special area on the media to indicate the disc's write protect status.

### -field IMAPI_WRITEPROTECTED_BY_DISC_CONTROL_BLOCK

A write-protect flag in the disc control block of a DVD+RW disc is set. DVD+RW media can persistently alter the write protect state of media by writing a device control block (DCB) to the media.  

This value has limited usefulness because some DVD+RW drives do not recognize or honor this setting.

### -field IMAPI_WRITEPROTECTED_READ_ONLY_MEDIA

The drive does not recognize write capability of the media.
