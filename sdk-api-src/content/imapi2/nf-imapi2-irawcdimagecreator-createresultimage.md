# IRawCDImageCreator::CreateResultImage


## -description


Creates the final <b>IStream</b> object based on the current settings.



## -parameters




### -param resultStream [out, optional]

Pointer to the finalized IStream object.


## -returns



S_OK is returned on success, but other success codes may be returned as a result of implementation.




## -remarks



<b>IRawCDImageCreator::CreateResultImage</b> can only be called once, and will result in the object becoming read-only. All properties associated with this object can  be read but not modified.  The resulting <b>IStream</b> object will be a disc image which starts at MSF 95:00:00, to allow writing of a single image to media with multiple starting addresses.

This method is supported in Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1), Windows XP with Service Pack 2 (SP2),  and Windows Vista  via the Windows Feature Pack for Storage. All  features provided by this  update package are supported natively in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.
