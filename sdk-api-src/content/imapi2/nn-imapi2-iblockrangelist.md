# IBlockRangeList interface


## -description

Use this interface to retrieve a list of continuous sector ranges on the media. This interface is used to describe the sectors that need to be updated on a rewritable disc when a new logical session is recorded.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IBlockRangeList</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oaidl/nn-oaidl-idispatch">IDispatch</a> interface. <b>IBlockRangeList</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

<b>IBlockRangeList</b> is returned by the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/imapi2fs/nf-imapi2fs-ifilesystemimageresult2-get_modifiedblocks">IFileSystemImageResult2::ModifiedBlocks</a> method. Alternatively, IUnknown::QueryInterface can be called on the object returned by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/imapi2fs/nf-imapi2fs-ifilesystemimageresult-get_imagestream">IFileSystemImageResult::get_ImageStream</a> to get the list of modified sectors in the result image represented by that object.

The order of sector ranges in <b>IBlockRangeList</b> is taken into account during burning. The sector ranges having lower indexes in the safe array returned by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/imapi2/nf-imapi2-iblockrangelist-get_blockranges">IBlockRangeList::get_BlockRanges</a> are written before those with higher indexes.
