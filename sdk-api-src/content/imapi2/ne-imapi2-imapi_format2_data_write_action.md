# IMAPI_FORMAT2_DATA_WRITE_ACTION enumeration


## -description


Defines values that indicate the current state of the write operation when using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/imapi2/nn-imapi2-idiscformat2dataeventargs">IDiscFormat2DataEventArgs</a> interface.


## -enum-fields




### -field IMAPI_FORMAT2_DATA_WRITE_ACTION_VALIDATING_MEDIA

Validating that the current media is supported.


### -field IMAPI_FORMAT2_DATA_WRITE_ACTION_FORMATTING_MEDIA

Formatting media, when required.


### -field IMAPI_FORMAT2_DATA_WRITE_ACTION_INITIALIZING_HARDWARE

Initializing the hardware, for example, setting drive write speeds.


### -field IMAPI_FORMAT2_DATA_WRITE_ACTION_CALIBRATING_POWER

Optimizing laser intensity for writing to the media.


### -field IMAPI_FORMAT2_DATA_WRITE_ACTION_WRITING_DATA

Writing data to the media.


### -field IMAPI_FORMAT2_DATA_WRITE_ACTION_FINALIZATION

Finalizing the write.  This state is media dependent and can include items such as closing the track or session, or finishing background formatting.


### -field IMAPI_FORMAT2_DATA_WRITE_ACTION_COMPLETED

Successfully finished the write process.


### -field IMAPI_FORMAT2_DATA_WRITE_ACTION_VERIFYING

Verifying the integrity of the burned media.
