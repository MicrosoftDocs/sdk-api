# IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_TYPE enumeration


## -description


Defines the sector types that can be written to CD media.


## -enum-fields




### -field IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_AUDIO

With this sector type, Audio data has 2352 bytes per sector/frame.  This can be broken down into 588 contiguous samples, each sample being four bytes.  The layout of a single sample matches the 16-bit stereo 44.1KHz WAV file data.  This type of sector has no additional error correcting codes.


### -field IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_MODE_ZERO

With this sector type, user data has 2336 bytes per sector/frame.  This seldom-used sector type contains all zero data, and is almost never seen in media today.


### -field IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_MODE1

With this sector type, user data has 2048 bytes per sector/frame.  Mode1 data is the most common data form for pressed CD-ROM media.  This data type also provides the greatest level of ECC/EDC among the standard sector types.


### -field IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_MODE2FORM0

With this sector type, user data has 2336 bytes per sector/frame.  All Mode 2 sector types are also known as "CD-ROM XA" modes, which allows mixing of audio and data tracks on a single disc.  This sector type is also known as Mode 2 "Formless", is considered deprecated, and is very seldom used.


### -field IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_MODE2FORM1

With this sector type, user data has 2048 bytes per sector/frame.  All Mode 2 sector types are also known as "CD-ROM XA" modes, which allows mixing of audio and data tracks on a single disc.


### -field IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_MODE2FORM2

With this sector type, user data has 2336 bytes per sector/frame, of which the final four bytes are an optional CRC code (zero if not used).  All Mode 2 sector types are also known as "CD-ROM XA" modes, which allows mixing of audio and data tracks on a single disc.  This sector type is most often used when writing VideoCD discs.


### -field IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_MODE1RAW

With this sector type, user data has 2352 bytes per sector/frame.  This is pre-processed Mode1Cooked data sectors, with sector header, ECC/EDC, and scrambling already added to the data stream.


### -field IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_MODE2FORM0RAW

With this sector type, user data has 2352 bytes per sector/frame.  This is pre-processed Mode2Form0 data sectors, with sector header, ECC/EDC, and scrambling already added to the data stream.


### -field IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_MODE2FORM1RAW

With this sector type, user data has 2352 bytes per sector/frame.  This is pre-processed Mode2Form1 data sectors, with sector header, ECC/EDC, and scrambling already added to the data stream.


### -field IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_MODE2FORM2RAW

With this sector type, user data has 2352 bytes per sector/frame.  This is pre-processed Mode2Form2 data sectors, with sector header, ECC/EDC, and scrambling already added to the data stream.


## -remarks



Some sector types are not compatible with other sector types within a single image.  The following are typical examples of this condition:

<ul>
<li>If the first track is audio, then all tracks must be audio.</li>
<li>If the first track is Mode1, then all tracks must be Mode1.</li>
<li>Only the three Mode2 (XA) sectors (Mode 2 Form 0, Mode 2 Form 1, and Mode 2 Form 2) may be mixed within a single disc image, and even then, only with other Mode 2 (XA) sector types.</li>
</ul>
