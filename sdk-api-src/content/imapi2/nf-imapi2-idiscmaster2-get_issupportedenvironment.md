Retrieves a value that determines if the environment contains one or more optical devices and the execution context has permission to access the devices.


## -parameters




### -param value

Is VARIANT_TRUE if the environment contains one or more optical devices and the execution context has permission to access the devices; otherwise, VARIANT_FALSE.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">

</td>
<td width="60%">

</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



This method loops through all the strings in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/imapi2/nf-imapi2-idiscmaster2-get_item">IDiscMaster2</a> and attempts to use each string to initialize a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/imapi2/nn-imapi2-idiscrecorder2">DiscRecorder2</a> object.  If any of the recorders on the system succeed the initialization, this method returns <b>TRUE</b>.

The environment must contain at least one type-5 optical device.
