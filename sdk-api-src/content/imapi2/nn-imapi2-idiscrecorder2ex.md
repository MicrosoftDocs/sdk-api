# IDiscRecorder2Ex interface


## -description

This interface represents a physical device. You use this interface to retrieve information about a CD and DVD device installed on the computer and to perform operations such as closing the tray or ejecting the media. This interface retrieves information not available through <a href="/windows/desktop/api/imapi2/nn-imapi2-idiscrecorder2">IDiscRecorder2</a> interface, and provides easier access to some of the same property values in <b>IDiscRecorder2</b>.

To get an instance of this interface, create an instance of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/imapi2/nn-imapi2-idiscrecorder2">IDiscRecorder2</a> interface and then call the <b>IDiscRecorder2::QueryInterface</b> method to retrieve the <b>IDiscRecorder2Ex</b> interface.

Note that you cannot access this functionality from script.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IDiscRecorder2Ex</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oaidl/nn-oaidl-idispatch">IDispatch</a> interface. <b>IDiscRecorder2Ex</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

To write data to media, you need to attach this recorder to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/imapi2/nn-imapi2-iwriteengine2">IWriteEngine2</a> data writer, using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/imapi2/nf-imapi2-iwriteengine2-put_recorder">IWriteEngine2::put_Recorder</a> method.
