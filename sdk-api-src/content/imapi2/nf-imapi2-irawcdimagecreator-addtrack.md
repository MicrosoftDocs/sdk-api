# IRawCDImageCreator::AddTrack


## -description


Accepts the provided <b>IStream</b> object and saves the interface pointer as the next track in the image.


## -parameters




### -param dataType [in]

A  value, defined by  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/imapi2/ne-imapi2-imapi_cd_sector_type">IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_TYPE</a>, that indicates the type of data. <b>IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_AUDIO</b> is the only value  supported by the <b>IRawCDImageCreator::AddTrack</b>  method.


### -param data [in, optional]

Pointer to the provided <b>IStream</b> object.


### -param trackIndex [out, retval]

A <b>LONG</b> value within a 1 to 99 range that will be associated with the new track.  


## -returns



S_OK is returned on success, but other success codes may be returned as a result of implementation.




## -remarks



Any additional tracks must be compatible with all existing tracks.  See the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/imapi2/ne-imapi2-imapi_cd_sector_type">IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_TYPE</a> enumeration for  information on limitations.

The data stream must be at least 4 seconds (300 sectors) long.  Data stream may not cause final sector to exceed LBA 398,099 (MSF 88:29:74), as leadout would then exceed the MSF 89:59:74 maximum.

This method is supported in Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1), Windows XP with Service Pack 2 (SP2),  and Windows Vista  via the Windows Feature Pack for Storage. All  features provided by this  update package are supported natively in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.
