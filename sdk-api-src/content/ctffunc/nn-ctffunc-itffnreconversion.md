# ITfFnReconversion interface


## -description

The <b>ITfFnReconversion</b> interface is implemented by a text service and is used by the TSF manager or a client to support reconversion of text provided by the text service.

The TSF manager implements this interface to provide access to this interface to other clients. This allows the TSF manager to function as a mediator between the client and the text service.

The TSF manager obtains this interface by calling the text service <a href="/windows/desktop/api/msctf/nf-msctf-itffunctionprovider-getfunction">ITfFunctionProvider::GetFunction</a> method with IID_ITfFnReconversion.

An application obtains this interface by calling the TSF manager <b>ITfFunctionProvider::GetFunction</b> method with IID_ITfFnReconversion.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">ITfFnReconversion</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>ITfFnReconversion</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

When a text service must interpret text before it is inserted into a context, there might be more than one possible interpretation of the text. Speech input is an example of this. If the spoken word is "there", other possible interpretations might be "their" or "they're". The text service will insert the most appropriate text, but there is still some chance of error involved. Text reconversion is the process of allowing the user to select alternate text for the inserted text.
