# CInstance::GetWCHAR


## -description

<p class="CCE_Message">[The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/instance/nl-instance-cinstance">CInstance</a> class 
    is part of the WMI Provider Framework which is now considered in final state, and no further development, 
    enhancements, or updates will be available for non-security related issues affecting these libraries. The 
    <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/wmi_v2/windows-management-infrastructure">MI APIs</a> should be used for all new 
    development.]

The <b>GetWCHAR</b> method retrieves a <b>WCHAR</b> string property.

## -parameters

### -param name

Name of the <b>WCHAR</b> string property retrieved.

### -param pW

Buffer that receives the <b>WCHAR</b> string property.

## -returns

Returns <b>TRUE</b> if the operation was successful and <b>FALSE</b> if an attempt was made to retrieve a property that is not a type that is <b>WCHAR</b> string-compatible or a property that does not exist. More information is available in the log file, Framework.log.

## -remarks

It is the responsibility of the implementer to free the memory occupied by the <b>WCHAR</b> string:


```cpp
    free(pw);
```


Use <b>free</b> rather than <b>delete</b> because the provider framework allocates the string using <b>malloc</b> and does not use the <b>new</b> operator.
