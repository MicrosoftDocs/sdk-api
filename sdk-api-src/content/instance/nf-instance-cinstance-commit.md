# CInstance::Commit


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/instance/nl-instance-cinstance">CInstance</a> class 
    is part of the WMI Provider Framework which is now considered in final state, and no further development, 
    enhancements, or updates will be available for non-security related issues affecting these libraries. The 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/wmi_v2/windows-management-infrastructure">MI APIs</a> should be used for all new 
    development.]

The <b>Commit</b> method returns the current instance to WMI.


## -parameters






## -returns



Use the <b>SUCCEEDED</b> or <b>FAILED</b> macro on the returned <b>HRESULT</b> to determine success or failure of the method.




## -remarks



If the client cancels the query, the <b>Commit</b> method returns an error. A provider writer can use this fact to terminate an enumeration.

Also, framework providers should call this method to commit rather than <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/provider/nf-provider-provider-commit">Provider::Commit</a>.  <b>Provider::Commit</b> calls <b>CInstance::Release</b> automatically. Smart <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/instance/nl-instance-cinstance">CInstance</a> pointers cannot be used in this case because the smart <b>CInstance</b> pointer would call <b>CInstance::Release</b> in its destructor. If the release has already occurred, an exception will result. Issues of this type are best resolved by allowing the <b>CInstance</b> instance, or a smart pointer to it, to call <b>CInstance::Release</b> when it is appropriate.
