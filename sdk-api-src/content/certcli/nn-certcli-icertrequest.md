# ICertRequest interface


## -description

The <b>ICertRequest</b> interface provides communications between a client or intermediary application and Certificate services.

Client and intermediary applications can call the  <b>ICertRequest</b> methods to perform the following tasks:<ul>
<li>Submit certificate request.</li>
<li>Retrieve the disposition, last status, and identifier of a request.</li>
<li>Retrieve the certificate issued for the request.</li>
<li>Retrieve pending certificates for previous requests.</li>
<li>Retrieve the <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">certification authority</a> (CA) certificate for the Certificate Services server.</li>
</ul>


<b>ICertRequest</b> is defined in Certcli.h. When you create your program, however, use Certsrv.h as the include file. Certcli.dll provides the <b>ICertRequest</b> interface. The type information for this interface is also in Certclil.dll, which is shipped with the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK).

Certificate Services interfaces support both apartment-threading and free-threading models. For better throughput, free threading is recommended.

## -inheritance
