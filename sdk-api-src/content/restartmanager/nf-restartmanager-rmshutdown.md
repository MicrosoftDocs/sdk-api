# RmShutdown function


## -description

Initiates the shutdown of applications.  This function can only be called from the installer that started the Restart Manager session using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/restartmanager/nf-restartmanager-rmstartsession">RmStartSession</a> function.

## -parameters

### -param dwSessionHandle [in]

A handle to an existing Restart Manager session.

### -param lActionFlags [in]

One or more   <a href="/windows/desktop/api/restartmanager/ne-restartmanager-rm_shutdown_type">RM_SHUTDOWN_TYPE</a> options that configure the shut down of components. The following values can be combined by an OR operator to specify that unresponsive applications and services are to be forced to shut down if, and only if, all applications have been registered for restart.

</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Force unresponsive applications and services to shut down after the timeout period. An application that does not respond to a shutdown request is forced to shut down within 30 seconds. A service that does not respond to a shutdown request is forced to shut down after 20 seconds.

### -param fnStatus [in, optional]

A pointer to an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/restartmanager/nc-restartmanager-rm_write_status_callback">RM_WRITE_STATUS_CALLBACK</a> function that is used to communicate detailed status while this function is executing. If <b>NULL</b>, no status is provided.

## -remarks

The <b>RmShutdown</b> function  calls <a href="/windows/desktop/api/restartmanager/nf-restartmanager-rmgetlist">RmGetList</a> and updates the list of processes currently using registered resources before attempting to shut down any processes. The  <b>RmShutdown</b> function then attempts to shut down the processes using registered resources in the most current list. The  <b>RmShutdown</b> function updates the <b>AppStatus</b>  member of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/restartmanager/ns-restartmanager-rm_process_info">RM_PROCESS_INFO</a> structures that are returned by the <b>RmGetList</b> function with detailed status information.

The Restart Manager respects the privileges that separate different user or terminal sessions. An installer that is running as a service with LocalSystem privileges cannot shut down or restart any applications in another user or terminal session.  Installers should implement custom methods to shut down and restart applications that are running in other sessions. One method would be to start a new   installer process  in the other session to perform shutdown and restart operations.

Installers should always restart application and services using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/restartmanager/nf-restartmanager-rmrestart">RmRestart</a> function even when the <b>RmShutdown</b> function returns an error indicating that not all applications and services could be shut down.
