## -description

Acts as the factory method for any services exposed through an implementation of [IServiceProvider](nn-servprov-iserviceprovider.md).

## -parameters

### -param guidService

The unique identifier of the service (an SID).

### -param pp

The address of the caller-allocated variable to receive the interface pointer of the service on successful return from this function. The caller becomes responsible for calling [Release](../unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-release.md) through this interface pointer when the service is no longer required.

## -returns

S_OK on success.

## -remarks

**QueryService** creates or accesses the implementation of the service identified with guidService. In ppv, it returns the address of the interface that is specified by riid.
