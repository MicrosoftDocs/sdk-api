# IPortableDeviceServiceMethodCallback interface


## -description

The <b>IPortableDeviceServiceMethodCallback</b> interface contains a method that applications use to track the completion of a callback method.  Applications that call service methods asynchronously may implement this interface, and supply it as a parameter to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/portabledeviceapi/nf-portabledeviceapi-iportabledeviceservicemethods-invokeasync">IPortableDeviceServiceMethods::InvokeAsync</a>. 

Each asynchronous method invocation uses the application-supplied callback object as its context. Therefore, an application that intends to simultaneously invoke multiple methods should avoid reusing the callback object. Instead, the application should provide a unique instance of the callback object for each call to <b>InvokeAsync</b>

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IPortableDeviceServiceMethodCallback</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IPortableDeviceServiceMethodCallback</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -members

The <b>IPortableDeviceServiceMethodCallback</b> interface has these methods.
