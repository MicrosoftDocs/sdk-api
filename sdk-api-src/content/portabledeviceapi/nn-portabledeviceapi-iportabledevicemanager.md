# IPortableDeviceManager interface


## -description

Enumerates devices that are connected to the computer and provides a simple way to request installation information, including manufacturer, friendly name, and description. This is typically the first Windows Portable Devices interface created by an application. To create an instance of this interface, call <b>CoCreateInstance</b> and specify <b>CLSID_PortableDeviceManager</b>.

The properties that are requested using this interface can also be requested by using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/portabledeviceapi/nn-portabledeviceapi-iportabledeviceproperties">IPortableDeviceProperties</a> interface. However, that interface requires several steps to acquire; using this interface is a much simpler way to request device information.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IPortableDeviceManager</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IPortableDeviceManager</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>
