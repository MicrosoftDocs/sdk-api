# IADsOpenDSObject interface


## -description

The <b>IADsOpenDSObject</b> interface is designed to supply a security context for binding to an object in the underlying directory store. It provides a means for specifying credentials of a client. Use this interface to bind to an ADSI object when you must supply a set of credentials for authentication in any directory service.

ADSI maintains the security context in its cache. Thus, throughout the connection within a process, Once authenticated, the supplied user credentials are applied to any actions performed on this object and its children. This credential caching model applies to binding to different objects as well, provided that the binding takes place within the same connection and process.

Calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/iads/nf-iads-iadsopendsobject-opendsobject">OpenDSObject</a> method of this interface yields the cache handle. Releasing this cache handle releases the security context as well.
