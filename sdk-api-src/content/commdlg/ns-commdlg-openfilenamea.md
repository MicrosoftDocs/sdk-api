# OPENFILENAMEA structure


## -description

<p class="CCE_Message">[Starting with Windows Vista, the <b>Open</b> and <b>Save As</b> common dialog boxes have been superseded by the <a href="/windows/win32/shell/common-file-dialog">Common Item Dialog</a>. We recommended that you use the Common Item Dialog API instead of these dialog boxes from the Common Dialog Box Library.]

Contains information that the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/commdlg/nf-commdlg-getopenfilenamea">GetOpenFileName</a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/commdlg/nf-commdlg-getsavefilenamea">GetSaveFileName</a> functions use to initialize an <b>Open</b> or <b>Save As</b> dialog box. After the user closes the dialog box, the system returns information about the user's selection in this structure.

## -struct-fields

### -field lStructSize

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The length, in bytes, of the structure. 
                     Use <code>sizeof (OPENFILENAME)</code> for this parameter.

### -field hwndOwner

Type: <b>HWND</b>

A handle to the window that owns the dialog box. This member can be any valid window handle, or it can be <b>NULL</b> if the dialog box has no owner.

### -field hInstance

Type: <b>HINSTANCE</b>

If the <b>OFN_ENABLETEMPLATEHANDLE</b> flag is set in the <b>Flags</b> member, <b>hInstance</b> is a handle to a memory object containing a dialog box template. If the <b>OFN_ENABLETEMPLATE</b> flag is set, <b>hInstance</b> is a handle to a module that contains a dialog box template named by the <b>lpTemplateName</b> member. If neither flag is set, this member is ignored. If the <b>OFN_EXPLORER</b> flag is set, the system uses the specified template to create a dialog box that is a child of the default Explorer-style dialog box. If the <b>OFN_EXPLORER</b> flag is not set, the system uses the template to create an old-style dialog box that replaces the default dialog box.

### -field lpstrFilter

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

A buffer containing pairs of null-terminated filter strings. The last string in the buffer must be terminated by two <b>NULL</b> characters. 

The first string in each pair is a display string that describes the filter (for example, "Text Files"), and the second string specifies the filter pattern (for example, <code>"*.TXT"</code>). To specify multiple filter patterns for a single display string, use a semicolon to separate the patterns (for example, <code>"*.TXT;*.DOC;*.BAK"</code>). A pattern string can be a combination of valid file name characters and the asterisk (\*) wildcard character. Do not include spaces in the pattern string.

The system does not change the order of the filters. It displays them in the <b>File Types</b> combo box in the order specified in <b>lpstrFilter</b>.

If <b>lpstrFilter</b> is <b>NULL</b>, the dialog box does not display any filters.

 In the case of a shortcut, if no filter is set, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/commdlg/nf-commdlg-getopenfilenamea">GetOpenFileName</a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/commdlg/nf-commdlg-getsavefilenamea">GetSaveFileName</a> retrieve the name of the .lnk file, not its target. This behavior is the same as setting the <b>OFN_NODEREFERENCELINKS</b> flag in the <b>Flags</b> member. To retrieve a shortcut's target without filtering, use the string <code>"All Files\0*.*\0\0"</code>.

### -field lpstrCustomFilter

Type: <b>LPTSTR</b>

A static buffer that contains a pair of null-terminated filter strings for preserving the filter pattern chosen by the user. The first string is your display string that describes the custom filter, and the second string is the filter pattern selected by the user. The first time your application creates the dialog box, you specify the first string, which can be any nonempty string. When the user selects a file, the dialog box copies the current filter pattern to the second string. The preserved filter pattern can be one of the patterns specified in the <b>lpstrFilter</b> buffer, or it can be a filter pattern typed by the user. The system uses the strings to initialize the user-defined file filter the next time the dialog box is created. If the <b>nFilterIndex</b> member is zero, the dialog box uses the custom filter. 

If this member is <b>NULL</b>, the dialog box does not preserve user-defined filter patterns.

If this member is not <b>NULL</b>, the value of the <b>nMaxCustFilter</b> member must specify the size, in characters, of the <b>lpstrCustomFilter</b> buffer.

### -field nMaxCustFilter

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The size, in characters, of the buffer identified by <b>lpstrCustomFilter</b>. This buffer should be at least 40 characters long. This member is ignored if <b>lpstrCustomFilter</b> is <b>NULL</b> or points to a <b>NULL</b> string.

### -field nFilterIndex

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The index of the currently selected filter in the <b>File Types</b> control. The buffer pointed to by <b>lpstrFilter</b> contains pairs of strings that define the filters. The first pair of strings has an index value of 1, the second pair 2, and so on. An index of zero indicates the custom filter specified by	<b>lpstrCustomFilter</b>. You can specify an index on input to indicate the initial filter description and filter pattern for the dialog box. When the user selects a file, <b>nFilterIndex</b> returns the index of the currently displayed filter. If <b>nFilterIndex</b> is zero and <b>lpstrCustomFilter</b> is <b>NULL</b>, the system uses the first filter in the <b>lpstrFilter</b> buffer. If all three members are zero or <b>NULL</b>, the system does not use any filters and does not show any files in the file list control of the dialog box.

### -field lpstrFile

Type: <b>LPTSTR</b>

The file name used to initialize the <b>File Name</b> edit control. The first character of this buffer must be <b>NULL</b> if initialization is not necessary. When the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/commdlg/nf-commdlg-getopenfilenamea">GetOpenFileName</a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/commdlg/nf-commdlg-getsavefilenamea">GetSaveFileName</a> function returns successfully, this buffer contains the drive designator, path, file name, and extension of the selected file.

If the <b>OFN_ALLOWMULTISELECT</b> flag is set and the user selects multiple files, the buffer contains the current directory followed by the file names of the selected files. For Explorer-style dialog boxes, the directory and file name strings are <b>NULL</b> separated, with an extra <b>NULL</b> character after the last file name. For old-style dialog boxes, the strings are space separated and the function uses short file names for file names with spaces. You can use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-findfirstfilea">FindFirstFile</a> function to convert between long and short file names. If the user selects only one file, the <b>lpstrFile</b> string does not have a separator between the path and file name.

If the buffer is too small, the function returns <b>FALSE</b> and the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/commdlg/nf-commdlg-commdlgextendederror">CommDlgExtendedError</a> function returns <b>FNERR_BUFFERTOOSMALL</b>. In this case, the first two bytes of the <b>lpstrFile</b> buffer contain the required size, in bytes or characters.

### -field nMaxFile

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The size, in characters, of the buffer pointed to by <b>lpstrFile</b>. The buffer must be large enough to store the path and file name string or strings, including the terminating <b>NULL</b> character. The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/commdlg/nf-commdlg-getopenfilenamea">GetOpenFileName</a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/commdlg/nf-commdlg-getsavefilenamea">GetSaveFileName</a> functions return <b>FALSE</b> if the buffer is too small to contain the file information. The buffer should be at least 256 characters long.

### -field lpstrFileTitle

Type: <b>LPTSTR</b>

The file name and extension (without path information) of the selected file. This member can be <b>NULL</b>.

### -field nMaxFileTitle

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The size, in characters, of the buffer pointed to by <b>lpstrFileTitle</b>. This member is ignored if <b>lpstrFileTitle</b> is <b>NULL</b>.

### -field lpstrInitialDir

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

The initial directory. The algorithm for selecting the initial directory varies on different platforms.

<b>Windows 7:</b>

<ol>
<li>If <b>lpstrInitialDir</b> has the same value as was passed the first time the application used an <b>Open</b> or <b>Save As</b> dialog box, the path most recently selected by the user is used as the initial directory.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if <b>lpstrFile</b> contains a path, that path is the initial directory.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if <b>lpstrInitialDir</b> is not <b>NULL</b>, it specifies the initial directory.</li>
<li>If <b>lpstrInitialDir</b> is <b>NULL</b> and the current directory contains any files of the specified filter types, the initial directory is the current directory.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the initial directory is the personal files directory of the current user.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the initial directory is the Desktop folder.</li>
</ol>
<b>Windows 2000/XP/Vista:</b>

<ol>
<li>If <b>lpstrFile</b> contains a path, that path is the initial directory.</li>
<li>Otherwise, <b>lpstrInitialDir</b> specifies the initial directory.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if the application has used an <b>Open</b> or <b>Save As</b> dialog box in the past, the path most recently used is selected as the initial directory. However, if an application is not run for a long time, its saved selected path is discarded.</li>
<li>If <b>lpstrInitialDir</b> is <b>NULL</b> and the current directory contains any files of the specified filter types, the initial directory is the current directory.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the initial directory is the personal files directory of the current user.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the initial directory is the Desktop folder.</li>
</ol>

### -field lpstrTitle

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

A string to be placed in the title bar of the dialog box. If this member is <b>NULL</b>, the system uses the default title (that is, <b>Save As</b> or <b>Open</b>).

### -field Flags

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

A set of bit flags you can use to initialize the dialog box. When the dialog box returns, it sets these flags to indicate the user's input. This member can be a combination of the following flags.

<table>

<td width="60%">
The <b>File Name</b> list box allows multiple selections. If you also set the <b>OFN_EXPLORER</b> flag, the dialog box uses the Explorer-style user interface; otherwise, it uses the old-style user interface.

If the user selects more than one file, the <b>lpstrFile</b> buffer returns the path to the current directory followed by the file names of the selected files. The <b>nFileOffset</b> member is the offset, in bytes or characters, to the first file name, and the <b>nFileExtension</b> member is not used. For Explorer-style dialog boxes, the directory and file name strings are <b>NULL</b> separated, with an extra <b>NULL</b> character after the last file name. This format enables the Explorer-style dialog boxes to return long file names that include spaces. For old-style dialog boxes, the directory and file name strings are separated by spaces and the function uses short file names for file names with spaces. You can use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-findfirstfilea">FindFirstFile</a> function to convert between long and short file names.

If you specify a custom template for an old-style dialog box, the definition of the <b>File Name</b> list box must contain the <b>LBS_EXTENDEDSEL</b> value.

If the user specifies a file that does not exist, this flag causes the dialog box to prompt the user for permission to create the file. If the user chooses to create the file, the dialog box closes and the function returns the specified name; otherwise, the dialog box remains open. If you use this flag with the <b>OFN_ALLOWMULTISELECT</b> flag, the dialog box allows the user to specify only one nonexistent file.

### -field nFileOffset

Type: <b>WORD</b>

The zero-based offset, in characters, from the beginning of the path to the file name in the string pointed to by <b>lpstrFile</b>. For the ANSI version, this is the number of bytes; for the Unicode version, this is the number of characters. For example, if <b>lpstrFile</b> points to the following string, "c:\dir1\dir2\file.ext", this member contains the value 13 to indicate the offset of the "file.ext" string. If the user selects more than one file, <b>nFileOffset</b> is the offset to the first file name.

### -field nFileExtension

Type: <b>WORD</b>

The zero-based offset, in characters, from the beginning of the path to the file name extension in the string pointed to by <b>lpstrFile</b>. For the ANSI version, this is the number of bytes; for the Unicode version, this is the number of characters. Usually the file name extension is the substring which follows the last occurrence of the dot (".") character. For example, txt is the extension of the filename readme.txt, html the extension of readme.txt.html. Therefore, if <b>lpstrFile</b> points to the string "c:\dir1\dir2\readme.txt", this member contains the value 20. If <b>lpstrFile</b> points to the string  "c:\dir1\dir2\readme.txt.html", this member contains the value 24. If <b>lpstrFile</b> points to the string  "c:\dir1\dir2\readme.txt.html.", this member contains the value 29. If <b>lpstrFile</b> points to a string that does not contain any "." character such as "c:\dir1\dir2\readme", this member contains zero.

### -field lpstrDefExt

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

The default extension. <a href="/windows/desktop/api/commdlg/nf-commdlg-getopenfilenamea">GetOpenFileName</a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/commdlg/nf-commdlg-getsavefilenamea">GetSaveFileName</a> append this extension to the file name if the user fails to type an extension. This string can be any length, but only the first three characters are appended. The string should not contain a period (.). If this member is <b>NULL</b> and the user fails to type an extension, no extension is appended.

### -field lCustData

Type: <b>LPARAM</b>

Application-defined data that the system passes to the hook procedure identified by the <b>lpfnHook</b> member. When the system sends the <a href="/windows/desktop/dlgbox/wm-initdialog">WM_INITDIALOG</a> message to the hook procedure, the message's <i>lParam</i> parameter is a pointer to the <b>OPENFILENAME</b> structure specified when the dialog box was created. The hook procedure can use this pointer to get the <b>lCustData</b> value.

### -field lpfnHook

Type: <b>LPOFNHOOKPROC</b>

A pointer to a hook procedure. This member is ignored unless the <b>Flags</b> member includes the <b>OFN_ENABLEHOOK</b> flag.

If the <b>OFN_EXPLORER</b> flag is not set in the <b>Flags</b> member, <b>lpfnHook</b> is a pointer to an <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms646932(v=vs.85)">OFNHookProcOldStyle</a> hook procedure that receives messages intended for the dialog box. The hook procedure returns <b>FALSE</b> to pass a message to the default dialog box procedure or <b>TRUE</b> to discard the message.

If <b>OFN_EXPLORER</b> is set, <b>lpfnHook</b> is a pointer to an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/commdlg/nc-commdlg-lpofnhookproc">OFNHookProc</a> hook procedure. The hook procedure receives notification messages sent from the dialog box. The hook procedure also receives messages for any additional controls that you defined by specifying a child dialog template. The hook procedure does not receive messages intended for the standard controls of the default dialog box.

### -field lpTemplateName

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

The name of the dialog template resource in the module identified by the <b>hInstance</b> member. For numbered dialog box resources, this can be a value returned by the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-makeintresourcea">MAKEINTRESOURCE</a> macro. This member is ignored unless the <b>OFN_ENABLETEMPLATE</b> flag is set in the <b>Flags</b> member. If the <b>OFN_EXPLORER</b> flag is set, the system uses the specified template to create a dialog box that is a child of the default Explorer-style dialog box. If the <b>OFN_EXPLORER</b> flag is not set, the system uses the template to create an old-style dialog box that replaces the default dialog box.

### -field lpEditInfo

This member is conditionally compiled (using `#ifdef _MAC`) so that it is applicable only to Motorola 68K Macintosh computers, and not to Windows client operating systems.

### -field lpstrPrompt

This member is conditionally compiled (using `#ifdef _MAC`) so that it is applicable only to Motorola 68K Macintosh computers, and not to Windows client operating systems.

### -field pvReserved

Type: <b>void*</b>

This member is reserved.

### -field dwReserved

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

This member is reserved.

### -field FlagsEx

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

 A set of bit flags you can use to initialize the dialog box. Currently, this member can be zero or the following flag.

## -remarks

For compatibility reasons, the Places Bar is hidden if <b>Flags</b> is set to <b>OFN_ENABLEHOOK</b> and <b>lStructSize</b> is <b>OPENFILENAME_SIZE_VERSION_400</b>.





> [!NOTE]
> The commdlg.h header defines OPENFILENAME as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
