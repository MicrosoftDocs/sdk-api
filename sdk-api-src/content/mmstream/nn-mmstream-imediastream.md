# IMediaStream interface


## -description

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This interface is deprecated. New applications should not use it.</div>
<div> </div>
The <b>IMediaStream</b> interface provides access to the characteristics of a media stream, such as the stream's media type and purpose ID. It also has methods that create data samples.

For sample code that implements the multimedia streaming interfaces, see <a href="/windows/desktop/DirectShow/multimedia-streaming-sample-code">Multimedia Streaming Sample Code</a>.

Implement this interface when you want to add media type-specific functionality to your media stream. This interface is implemented on multimedia stream objects. <b>IMediaStream</b> provides generic sample-creation methods, but you usually want to write a more powerful version of these methods that will take advantage of your media type's specific characteristics.

Use this interface when your application needs to access a stream's media type information and create data samples.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IMediaStream</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IMediaStream</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
