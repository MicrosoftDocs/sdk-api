# Shellhandwriting.h header

## -description

Enables inking with a pen on, or near, any edit control without first setting focus on the edit control. The system renders the ink strokes, recognizes the ink as text (or a gesture for modifying text), and inserts the new or modified text into the edit field of the control.

This header is used by Ink input. For more information, see:

- [Ink input](../_input_ink/index.md)
