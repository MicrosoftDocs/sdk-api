# CREDENTIAL_TARGET_INFORMATIONA structure


## -description

The <b>CREDENTIAL_TARGET_INFORMATION</b> structure contains the target computer's name, domain, and tree.

## -struct-fields

### -field TargetName

Name of the target server as specified by the caller accessing the target. It is typically the NetBIOS or DNS name of the target server.

### -field NetbiosServerName

NetBIOS name of the target server. If the name is not known, this member can be <b>NULL</b>.

### -field DnsServerName

DNS name of the target server. If the name is not known, this member can be <b>NULL</b>.

### -field NetbiosDomainName

NetBIOS name of the target server's domain. If the name is not known, this member can be <b>NULL</b>. If the target server is a member of a workgroup, this member must be <b>NULL</b>.

### -field DnsDomainName

DNS name of the target server's domain. If the name is not known, this member can be <b>NULL</b>. If the target server is a member of a workgroup, this member must be <b>NULL</b>.

### -field DnsTreeName

DNS name of the target server's tree. If the tree name is not known, this member can be <b>NULL</b>. If the target server is a member of a workgroup, this member must be <b>NULL</b>.

### -field PackageName

Name of the authentication package that determined the values <b>NetbiosServerName</b>, <b>DnsServerName</b>, <b>NetbiosDomainName</b>, <b>DnsDomainName</b>, and <b>DnsTreeName</b> as a function of <b>TargetName</b>. This member can be passed to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/sspi/nf-sspi-acquirecredentialshandlea">AcquireCredentialsHandle</a> as the package name.

### -field Flags

Attributes of the target. 




<ul>
<li>CRED_TI_SERVER_FORMAT_UNKNOWN 


(1) — Set if the authentication package cannot determine whether the server name is a DNS name or a NetBIOS name. In that case, the <b>NetbiosServerName</b> member is set to <b>NULL</b> and the <b>DnsServerName</b> member is set to the server name of unknown format.

</li>
<li>CRED_TI_DOMAIN_FORMAT_UNKNOWN 


(2) — Set if the authentication package cannot determine whether the domain name is a DNS name or a NetBIOS name. In that case, the <b>NetbiosDomainName</b> member is set to <b>NULL</b> and the <b>DnsDomainName</b> member is set to the domain name of unknown format.

</li>
<li>CRED_TI_ONLY_PASSWORD_REQUIRED 


(4) — Set if the authentication package has determined that the server only needs a password to authenticate. The caller can use this flag  to prompt only for a password and not a user name.

Stored credentials require a UserName member. A value of &lt;<i>DnsServerName</i>&gt;\Guest or &lt;<i>NetbiosServerName</i>&gt;\Guest should be used for these servers.

</li>
</ul>

### -field CredTypeCount

Number of elements in the <b>CredTypes</b> array.

### -field CredTypes

Array specifying the credential types acceptable by the authentication package used by the target server. Each element is one of the CRED_TYPE_* defines. The order of this array specifies the preference order of the authentication package. More preferable types are specified earlier in the list.

## -remarks

> [!NOTE]
> The wincred.h header defines CREDENTIAL_TARGET_INFORMATION as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
