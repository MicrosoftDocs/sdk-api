<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincred/nf-wincred-creduipromptforcredentialsa">CredUIPromptForCredentials</a> function that creates a dialog box used to obtain credentials information.


## -struct-fields




### -field cbSize

Set to the size of the CREDUI_INFO structure.


### -field hwndParent

### -field pszMessageText

Pointer to a string containing a brief message to display in the dialog box. The length of this string should not exceed CREDUI_MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH.

## -remarks

> [!NOTE]
> The wincred.h header defines CREDUI_INFO as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
