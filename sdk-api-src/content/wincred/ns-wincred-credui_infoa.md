## -description

The <b>CREDUI_INFO</b> structure is used to pass information to the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/wincred/nf-wincred-creduipromptforcredentialsa">CredUIPromptForCredentials</a> function that creates a dialog box used to obtain credentials information.

## -struct-fields

### -field cbSize

Set to the size of the CREDUI_INFO structure.

### -field hwndParent

Specifies the handle to the parent window of the dialog box. The dialog box is modal with respect to the parent window. If this member is <b>NULL</b>, the desktop is the parent window of the dialog box.

### -field pszMessageText

Pointer to a string containing a brief message to display in the dialog box. The length of this string should not exceed CREDUI_MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH.

### -field pszCaptionText

Pointer to a string containing the title for the dialog box. The length of this string should not exceed CREDUI_MAX_CAPTION_LENGTH.

### -field hbmBanner

Bitmap to display in the dialog box. If this member is <b>NULL</b>, a default bitmap is used. The bitmap size is limited to 320x60 pixels.

## -remarks

> [!NOTE]
> The wincred.h header defines CREDUI_INFO as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
