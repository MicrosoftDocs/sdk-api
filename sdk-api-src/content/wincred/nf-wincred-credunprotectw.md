# CredUnprotectW function


## -description

The <b>CredUnprotect</b> function decrypts credentials that were previously encrypted by using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wincred/nf-wincred-credprotecta">CredProtect</a> function. The credentials must have been encrypted in the same security context in which <b>CredUnprotect</b> is called.

## -parameters

### -param fAsSelf [in]

Set to <b>TRUE</b> to specify that the credentials were encrypted in the security context of the current process. Set to <b>FALSE</b> to specify that credentials were encrypted in the security context of the calling thread security context.

### -param pszProtectedCredentials [in]

A pointer to a string that specifies the encrypted credentials.

### -param cchProtectedCredentials [in]

The size, in characters, of the <i>pszProtectedCredentials</i> buffer.

### -param pszCredentials [out]

A pointer to a string that, on output, receives the decrypted credentials.

### -param pcchMaxChars [in, out]

The size, in characters of the <i>pszCredentials</i> buffer. On output, if the <i>pszCredentials</i> is not of sufficient size to receive the encrypted credentials, this parameter specifies the required size, in characters, of the <i>pszCredentials</i> buffer.

## -returns

<b>TRUE</b> if the function succeeds; otherwise, <b>FALSE</b>.

For extended error information, call the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a> function. The following table shows common values for the <b>GetLastError</b> function.

## -remarks

> [!NOTE]
> The wincred.h header defines CredUnprotect as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
