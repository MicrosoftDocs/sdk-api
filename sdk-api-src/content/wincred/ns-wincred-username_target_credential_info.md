# USERNAME_TARGET_CREDENTIAL_INFO structure


## -description


The 
<b>USERNAME_TARGET_CREDENTIAL_INFO</b> structure contains a reference to a credential. This structure is used to pass a user name into the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincred/nf-wincred-credmarshalcredentiala">CredMarshalCredential</a> function and out of the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincred/nf-wincred-credunmarshalcredentiala">CredUnmarshalCredential</a>. The resultant marshaled credential can be passed as the <i>lpszUserName</i> parameter of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-logonusera">LogonUser</a> function to direct that API to get the password from the corresponding CRED_FLAGS_USERNAME_TARGET credential instead of from the <i>lpszPassword</i> parameter of the function.


## -struct-fields
