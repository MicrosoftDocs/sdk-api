# IDCompositionDevice2::Commit


## -description


Commits all DirectComposition commands that are pending on this device.


## -parameters






## -returns



Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">HRESULT</a></b>

If the function succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> 
       error code. See 
       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/directcomp/directcomposition-error-codes">DirectComposition Error Codes</a> for a 
       list of error codes.




## -remarks



Calls to DirectComposition methods are always batched and executed atomically as 
    a single transaction. Calls take effect only when 
    <b>IDCompositionDevice2::Commit</b> is 
    called, at which time all pending method calls for a device are executed at once.

An application that uses multiple devices must call 
    <b>Commit</b> for each device separately. 
    However, because the composition engine processes the calls individually, the batch of commands might not take 
    effect at the same time.
