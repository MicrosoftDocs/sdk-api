# IDCompositionDevice::Commit


## -description


Commits all DirectComposition commands that are pending on this device.


## -parameters






## -returns



Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">HRESULT</a></b>

If the function succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code. See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/directcomp/directcomposition-error-codes">DirectComposition Error Codes</a>  for a list of error codes.




## -remarks



Calls to DirectComposition methods are always batched and executed atomically as a single transaction. Calls take effect only when <b>IDCompositionDevice::Commit</b> is called, at which time all pending method calls for a device are executed at once. 

An application that uses multiple devices must call <b>Commit</b> for each device separately. However, because the composition engine processes the calls individually, the batch of commands might not take effect at the same time. 


#### Examples

For an example, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/directcomp/how-to--build-a-visual-tree">How to Build a Simple Visual Tree</a>.
