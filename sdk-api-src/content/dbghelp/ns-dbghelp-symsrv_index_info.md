## -struct-fields

### -field sizeofstruct

The size of the structure, in bytes. This member must be set to <code>sizeof(SYMSRV_INDEX_INFO)</code> or <code>sizeof(SYMSRV_INDEX_INFOW)</code>.

### -field file

The name of the .pdb, .dbg, or image file.

### -field stripped

A value that indicates whether the image file is stripped.

### -field timestamp

The timestamp from the PE header. This member is used only for image files.

### -field size

The file size from the PE header. This member is used only for image files.

### -field dbgfile

If the image file is stripped and there is a .dbg file, this member is the path to the .dbg file from the CV record.

### -field pdbfile

The .pdb file from the CV record. This member is used only for image and .dbg files.

### -field guid

The GUID of the .pdb file. If there is no GUID available, the signature of the .pdb file is copied into first <b>DWORD</b> of the GUID.

### -field sig

The signature of the .pdb file (for use with old-style .pdb files). This value can be 0 if it is a new-style .pdb file that uses a GUID-length signature.

### -field age
