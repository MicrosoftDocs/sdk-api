# OMAP structure


## -description

Describes an entry in an address map.

## -struct-fields

### -field rva

A relative virtual address (RVA) in image A.

### -field rvaTo

The relative virtual address that <b>rva</b> is mapped to in image B.

## -remarks

An address map provides a translation from one image layout (A) to another (B). An array of OMAP structures, sorted by <b>rva</b>, defines an address map.

To translate an address, addrA, in image A to an address, addrB, in image B, perform the following steps:

<ol>
<li>Search the map for the entry, e, with the largest rva less than or equal to addrA.</li>
<li>Set delta = addrA â€“ e.rva.</li>
<li>Set addrB = e.rvaTo + delta.</li>
</ol>
