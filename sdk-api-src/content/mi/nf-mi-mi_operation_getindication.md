# MI_Operation_GetIndication function


## -description


Get the synchronous results from a subscription.


## -parameters




### -param operation [in]

Operation handle returned from an instance session operation.


### -param instance

Returned indication instance. If the operation fails, this value may be <b>Null</b>. The returned class is valid until the next call to <b>MI_Operation_GetIndication</b> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mi/nf-mi-mi_operation_close">MI_Operation_Close</a>. If the class needs to be stay active across these calls, then the class needs to be cloned via <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mi/nf-mi-mi_instance_clone">MI_Instance_Clone</a>.


### -param bookmark

Some providers allow a subscription to resume from a particular indication result should the subscription fail or get shut down. If the provider supports this, then a bookmark is optionally returned with the instance. This bookmark can then be passed in to a future subscription to attempt to resume the subscription from that point. Most providers do not support this functionality.


### -param machineID

Returned machine identification indicating the origin of the event.


### -param moreResults [out, optional]

Returned Boolean value indicating if more results are available. A value of <b>MI_TRUE</b> means that more results can be retrieved. This function must be called until <b>moreResults</b> has a value of <b>MI_FALSE</b> (even if the operation is canceled via <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mi/nf-mi-mi_operation_cancel">MI_Operation_Cancel</a>). Calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mi/nf-mi-mi_operation_close">MI_Operation_Close</a> before retrieving the last result where <b>moreResults</b> is set to <b>MI_FALSE</b> will cause the <b>MI_Operation_Close</b> function to stop responding.


### -param result [out, optional]

Returned value indicating the success or failure of the function call. A value of <b>MI_RESULT_OK</b> indicates success. Otherwise, the returned <b>errorMessage</b> value should be used to determine the cause of failure.


### -param errorMessage

In the case of an error, this returned value provides additional debugging information as to the cause of failure. This error message has the same lifetime as the <b>classResult</b> value.


### -param completionDetails

In the case of an error, this returned value provides additional error information - typically in the form of a CIM_Error object (or a derived class). This returned instance has the same lifetime as the <b>classResult</b> value. If this value is needs to stay active longer, then the value needs to be cloned via <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mi/nf-mi-mi_instance_clone">MI_Instance_Clone</a>.


## -remarks



This function will block until a new indication arrives.  This function should not be called on non-subscription calls or a non-subscription operation.
