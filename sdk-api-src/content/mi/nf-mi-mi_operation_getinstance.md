# MI_Operation_GetInstance function


## -description


Gets a synchronous result for an instance operation.


## -parameters




### -param operation [in]

The operation handle returned from instance session operations.


### -param instance

Returned instance. This value may be <b>Null</b> even if the operation succeeds. The 
      returned instance is valid until the next call to 
      <b>MI_Operation_GetInstance</b> or 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mi/nf-mi-mi_operation_close">MI_Operation_Close</a>. If the instance needs to be 
      stay active across these calls, then the class needs to be cloned via 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mi/nf-mi-mi_instance_clone">MI_Instance_Clone</a>.


### -param moreResults [out, optional]

Returned Boolean value indicating if more results are available. A value of 
      <b>MI_TRUE</b> means that more results can be retrieved. This function must be called until 
      <b>moreResults</b> has a value of <b>MI_FALSE</b> (even if the operation 
      is canceled via <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mi/nf-mi-mi_operation_cancel">MI_Operation_Cancel</a>). Calling 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mi/nf-mi-mi_operation_close">MI_Operation_Close</a> before retrieving the last 
      result where <b>moreResults</b> is set to <b>MI_FALSE</b> will cause the 
      <b>MI_Operation_Close</b> function to stop 
      responding.


### -param result [out, optional]

Returned value indicating the success or failure of the function call. A value of 
      <b>MI_RESULT_OK</b> indicates success. Otherwise, the returned 
      <b>errorMessage</b> value should be used to determine the cause of failure.


### -param errorMessage

In the case of an error, this returned value provides additional debugging information as to the cause of 
      failure. This error message has the same lifetime as the <b>classResult</b> value.


### -param completionDetails

In the case of an error, this returned value provides additional error information - typically in the form 
      of a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/hyperv_v2/cim-error">CIM_Error</a> object (or a derived class). This returned 
      instance has the same lifetime as the <b>classResult</b> value. If this value is needs to 
      stay active longer, then the value needs to be cloned via 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mi/nf-mi-mi_instance_clone">MI_Instance_Clone</a>.


## -remarks



This function is called to get all synchronous results for all instance operations except subscriptions, where 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mi/nf-mi-mi_operation_getindication">MI_Operation_GetIndication</a> should be 
    used. This function will block until a result is available. It should be called until the 
    <b>moreResults</b> parameter is returned with a value of <b>MI_FALSE</b>. It 
    is an error to call this function if an instance callback is registered.
