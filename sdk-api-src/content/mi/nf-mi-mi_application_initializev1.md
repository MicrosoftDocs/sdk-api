# MI_Application_InitializeV1 function


## -description


Initializes an application so that it can make Management Infrastructure (MI) client API 
    calls.


## -parameters




### -param flags

Must be 0.


### -param applicationID [in, optional]

An optional string (usually <b>GUID</b> in string format) to represent a client 
    application. This string may be used for application specific configuration and application specific 
  logging.


### -param extendedError [out, optional]

Optional parameter giving more error information if the operation failed. If an instance is returned, 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mi/nf-mi-mi_instance_delete">MI_Instance_Delete</a> must  be called to free it 
      when it is no longer needed.


### -param application [out]

A pointer to an uninitialized <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mi/ns-mi-mi_application">MI_Application</a> 
      handle is passed in and a populated handle is returned. The initialized handle must be passed to 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mi/nf-mi-mi_application_close">MI_Application_Close</a> before the application 
  shuts down. If an application passes this handle, pass it by value rather than as a pointer.


## -returns



This function returns MI_Result MI_MAIN_CALL.




## -remarks



This API needs to be called only once per application; although, it can be called multiple times safely. 
    Calling this API multiple times will result in a small amount of extra memory usage.  When called, the application 
    passes in an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mi/ns-mi-mi_application">MI_Application</a> pointer to be initialized. 
    This pointer must be closed by calling 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mi/nf-mi-mi_application_close">MI_Application_Close</a>. Not doing so will cause 
    memory leaks and potential crashes during shutdown.

MI.h defines 
     <b>MI_Application_Initialize</b> as 
   <b>MI_Application_InitializeV1</b> with this 
     line:

<code>#define MI_Application_Initialize MI_Application_InitializeV1</code>
