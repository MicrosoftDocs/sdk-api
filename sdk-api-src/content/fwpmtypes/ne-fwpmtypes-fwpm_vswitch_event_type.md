# FWPM_VSWITCH_EVENT_TYPE enumeration


## -description


The <b>FWPM_VSWITCH_EVENT_TYPE</b> enumeration specifies the type of a vSwitch event.


## -enum-fields




### -field FWPM_VSWITCH_EVENT_FILTER_ADD_TO_INCOMPLETE_LAYER

The filter engine is not enabled on all vSwitch instances. As a result, the filter(s) being added may not be fully enforced.


### -field FWPM_VSWITCH_EVENT_FILTER_ENGINE_NOT_IN_REQUIRED_POSITION

The filter engine to which the filter(s) are being added is not in its required position (typically the first filtering extension in the vSwitch instance). As a result, the filter(s) could be bypassed.


### -field FWPM_VSWITCH_EVENT_ENABLED_FOR_INSPECTION

The filter engine is being enabled for the vSwitch instance.


### -field FWPM_VSWITCH_EVENT_DISABLED_FOR_INSPECTION

The filter engine is being disabled for the vSwitch instance.


### -field FWPM_VSWITCH_EVENT_FILTER_ENGINE_REORDER

The filter engine is being reordered and may not be in the
   required position to enforce committed filters.


### -field FWPM_VSWITCH_EVENT_MAX

Maximum value for testing purposes.
