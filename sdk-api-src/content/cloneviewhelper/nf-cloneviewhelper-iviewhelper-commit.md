# IViewHelper::Commit


## -description

The <b>Commit</b> method invalidates a Video Present Network (VidPN) on all graphics adapters.



## -returns

The <b>Commit</b> method returns one of the following values: 

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK </b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
<b>Commit</b> successfully invalidated a VidPN. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>Any other error code (that is defined in <i>Winerror.h</i>) will cause TMM to not restore connections.</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%"></td>
</tr>
</table>

## -remarks

After <b>Commit</b> succeeds, the sources and targets on all of the graphics adapters are set. 

TMM calls <b>Commit</b> whenever a set of operations must be applied. For example, TMM might call <b>Commit</b> after a call to the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff568174(v=vs.85)">IViewHelper::SetActiveTopology</a> method on a graphics adapter that requires for a source and targets to be mapped. TMM does not pass in the adapter name to <b>Commit</b> because the VidPN on all adapters should be invalidated. 

A call to <b>Commit</b> will no longer replace a call to <b>ChangeDisplaySettingsEx</b>(<b>NULL</b>, <b>NULL</b>, <b>NULL</b>, 0, <b>NULL</b>). However, TMM always ends its graphics operations with a <b>Commit</b> call. For more information about <b>ChangeDisplaySettingsEx</b>, see the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.
