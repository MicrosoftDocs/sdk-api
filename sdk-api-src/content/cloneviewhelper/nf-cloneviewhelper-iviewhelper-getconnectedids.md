# IViewHelper::GetConnectedIDs


## -description

The <b>GetConnectedIDs</b> method retrieves, for a given adapter, an array of identifiers for either targets or sources.

## -parameters

### -param wszAdaptorName [in]

[in] A NULL-terminated string that indicates the name of the adapter to retrieve identifiers for. The adapter name is obtained from the <b>DeviceKey</b> member of the DISPLAY_DEVICE structure. The adapter name was set in and returned from a call to the <b>EnumDisplayDevices</b> function. For more information about DISPLAY_DEVICE and <b>EnumDisplayDevices</b>, see the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.

### -param pulCount [in, out]

[in,out] A pointer to a variable that receives the number of entries in the array that will be subsequently returned in the buffer that <i>pulID</i> points to. For more information about how array entries are retrieved, see the Remarks section.

### -param pulID [in, out]

[in,out] A pointer to a buffer that receives the array of identifiers for the targets or sources.

### -param ulFlags [in]

[in] A flag value that identifies the type of identifiers to retrieve. <i>ulFlags</i> can be set to one of the following values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
GETCONNECTEDIDS_TARGET (0)

</td>
<td>
The array that the <i>pulID</i> parameter points to should contain connected (though not necessarily active) targets.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
GETCONNECTEDIDS_SOURCE (1)

</td>
<td>
The array that <i>pulID</i> points to should contain available sources.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## -returns

The <b>GetConnectedIDs</b> method returns one of the following values: 

<table>

</td>
<td width="60%">
The array that was passed in the <i>pulID</i> parameter cannot hold all of the data that <b>GetConnectedIDs</b> must insert. TMM will then query for the number of array elements again. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>Any other error code (that is defined in <i>Winerror.h</i>) will cause TMM to not act on the retrieved data.</b></dt>

</tr>
</table>

## -remarks

<b>GetConnectedIDs</b> is used to determine if two monitors that are connected to a graphics adapter can be placed into clone view.

 To qualify as a target, a monitor or other display device must be connected to the computer. For example, consider a graphics adapter with a Digital Video Interface (DVI) connector that supports output through DVI analog and DVI digital. <b>GetConnectedIDs</b> reports the target identifier of the DVI analog or DVI digital output connector only if a monitor is plugged into that connector. Therefore, a report of targets is not a report of all of the outputs that are available through the video ports. Rather, it is a report of what is physically attached to the graphics adapter. Each monitor is reported as a target whether the monitor is active or not.

In the first call to <b>GetConnectedIDs</b>, the <i>pulID </i>parameter is set to <b>NULL</b>, and the number of entries in the array of identifiers is retrieved in the variable that the <i>pulCount</i> parameter points to. In the second call to <b>GetConnectedIDs</b>, the number of entries that was retrieved in the first call is passed in the variable that <i>pulCount</i> points to, and an allocated array is passed to <i>pulCount</i>. This allocated array receives the identifiers of the targets or sources. 

<b>GetConnectedIDs</b> is called when a new second monitor is detected. The <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff568174(v=vs.85)">IViewHelper::SetActiveTopology</a> method must then be called to set the display on the adapter to clone view. The adapter name is the string that was obtained from the <b>DeviceKey</b> member of the DISPLAY_DEVICE structure in a call to the <b>EnumDisplayDevices</b> function. For more information about DISPLAY_DEVICE and <b>EnumDisplayDevices</b>, see the Windows SDK documentation.
