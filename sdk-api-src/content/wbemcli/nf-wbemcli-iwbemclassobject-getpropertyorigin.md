# IWbemClassObject::GetPropertyOrigin


## -description


The 
<b>IWbemClassObject::GetPropertyOrigin</b> method retrieves the name of the class in which a particular property was introduced. For classes with deep inheritance hierarchies, it is often desirable to know which properties were declared in which classes. If the object does not inherit from a parent class, as in the case of a base class, for example, then the current class name is returned.


## -parameters




### -param wszName [in]

Property name for which the owning class name is desired. This must point to a valid <b>LPCWSTR</b>, which is treated as read-only.


### -param pstrClassName [out]

Pointer to the address of a new <b>BSTR</b> that receives the parent class name. To prevent memory leaks in the client process, the caller must call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oleauto/nf-oleauto-sysfreestring">SysFreeString</a> when the name is no longer required. This parameter must not point to a valid string before the method is called because this is an output parameter, and this pointer is not deallocated after the call is complete.


## -returns



This method returns an <b>HRESULT</b> indicating the status of the method call. The following list lists the value contained within an <b>HRESULT</b>. For general <b>HRESULT</b> values, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Debug/system-error-codes">System Error Codes</a>.
