# IWbemClassObject::Clone


## -description


The 
<b>IWbemClassObject::Clone</b> method returns a new object that is a complete clone of the current object. The new object has a COM reference count of 1.


## -parameters




### -param ppCopy [out]

This parameter cannot be <b>NULL</b>. It receives the copy of the current object. You must call <b>IWbemClassObject::Release </b>on this object when it is no longer required.

A new object is not returned on error.


## -returns



This method returns an <b>HRESULT</b> indicating the status of the method call. The following list lists the value contained within an <b>HRESULT</b>. For general <b>HRESULT</b> values, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Debug/system-error-codes">System Error Codes</a>.




## -remarks



Use this method to duplicate a class definition, or to duplicate an instance. This can be useful when the original copy of the object is required for backup purposes while a new copy is modified. Likewise, use this method to create many new instances from a single source instance. For example, use 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wbemcli/nf-wbemcli-iwbemclassobject-spawninstance">IWbemClassObject::SpawnInstance</a> to create a single starting instance, and use 
<b>IWbemClassObject::Clone</b> to produce 100 copies of the instance quickly. Each object can be modified subsequently to take on its particular values.

It is not possible to use this method to convert a class definition into an instance, or convert an instance into a class definition.
