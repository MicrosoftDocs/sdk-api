#### - dwSize

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">DWORD</a></b>

Size, in bytes, of this structure. The property sheet manager uses this member to determine which version of the <b>PROPSHEETHEADER</b> structure you are using. For more information, see the Remarks.


#### - hIcon

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">HICON</a></b>

Handle to the icon to use as the small icon in the title bar of the property sheet dialog box. If the <b>dwFlags</b>  member does not include PSH_USEHICON, this member is ignored. This member is declared as a union with <b>pszIcon</b>.


#### - hInstance

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">HINSTANCE</a></b>

Handle to the instance from which to load the icon or title string resource. If the <b>pszIcon</b> or <b>pszCaption</b> member identifies a resource to load, this member must be specified.


#### - hwndParent

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">HWND</a></b>

Handle to the property sheet's owner window.


#### - nPages

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT</a></b>

Number of elements in the <b>phpage</b> array.


#### - nStartPage

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT</a></b>

Zero-based index of the initial page that appears when the property sheet dialog box is created. This member is declared as a union with <b>pStartPage</b>.


#### - pStartPage

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">LPCTSTR</a></b>

Name of the initial page that appears when the property sheet dialog box is created. This member can specify either the identifier of a string resource or the address of a string that specifies the name. This member is declared as a union with <b>nStartPage</b>.


#### - pfnCallback

Type: <b>PFNPROPSHEETCALLBACK</b>

Pointer to an application-defined callback function that is called when the property sheet is initialized. For more information about the callback function, see the description of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/prsht/nc-prsht-pfnpropsheetcallback">PropSheetProc</a> function. If the 
<b>dwFlags</b> member does not include PSH_USECALLBACK, this member is ignored.


#### - phpage

Type: <b>HPROPSHEETPAGE*</b>

Pointer to an array of handles to the property sheet pages. Each handle must have been created by a previous call to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/prsht/nf-prsht-createpropertysheetpagea">CreatePropertySheetPage</a> function. If the <b>dwFlags</b> member includes PSH_PROPSHEETPAGE, <b>phpage</b> is ignored and should be set to <b>NULL</b>. When the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/prsht/nf-prsht-propertysheeta">PropertySheet</a> function returns, any HPROPSHEETPAGE handles in the <b>phpage</b> array will have been destroyed. This member is declared as a union with <b>ppsp</b>.


#### - ppsp

Type: <b>LPCPROPSHEETPAGE</b>

Pointer to an array of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/prsht/ns-prsht-propsheetpagea_v2">PROPSHEETPAGE</a> structures that define the pages in the property sheet. If the <b>dwFlags</b> member does not include PSH_PROPSHEETPAGE, this member is ignored. Note that the <b>PROPSHEETPAGE</b> structure is variable in size. Applications that parse the array pointed to by <b>ppsp</b> must take the size of each page into account. This member is declared as a union with <b>phpage</b>.


#### - pszCaption

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">LPCTSTR</a></b>

Title of the property sheet dialog box. This member can specify either the identifier of a string resource or the address of a string that specifies the title. If the <b>dwFlags</b> member includes PSH_PROPTITLE, the string "Properties for" is inserted at the beginning of the title. This field is ignored for Wizard97 wizards. For Aero wizards, the string alone is used for the caption, regardless of whether the PSH_PROPTITLE flag is set.


#### - pszIcon

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">LPCTSTR</a></b>

Icon resource to use as the small icon in the title bar of the property sheet dialog box. This member can specify either the identifier of the icon resource or the address of the string that specifies the name of the icon resource. If the <b>dwFlags</b> member does not include PSH_USEICONID, this member is ignored. This member is declared as a union with <b>hIcon</b>.

## -remarks

If the user chooses a setting such as Large Fonts, which enlarges the dialog box, the watermark that is painted on the start and finish pages will be enlarged as well. The size and position of the original bitmap will remain the same. The additional area will be filled with the color of the pixel in the upper-left corner of the bitmap.

Note that several members of this structure are only supported for Comctl32.dll versions 4.71 and later. You can enable these members by including one of the following in your header. 

                

<code>#define _WIN32_IE 0x0400 // For version 4.71</code>

or
                

<code>#define _WIN32_IE 0x0500 // For version 5.80</code>

However, you must initialize the structure with its size. If you use the size of the currently defined structure, the application may not run with the earlier versions of Comctl32.dll, which expect a smaller structure. This includes all systems with Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 that do not have Internet Explorer 4.0 or later installed. You can run your application on pre-4.71 versions of Comctl32.dll by defining the appropriate <a href="/windows/desktop/Controls/common-controls-intro">version number</a>. However, this may cause problems if your application also needs to run on systems with more recent versions.

You can remain compatible with all Comctl32.dll versions by using the current header files and setting the size of the <b>PROPSHEETHEADER</b> structure appropriately. Before you initialize the structure, use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shlwapi/nc-shlwapi-dllgetversionproc">DllGetVersion</a> function to determine which Comctl32.dll version is installed on the system. If it is version 4.71 or greater, use

<code>psh.dwSize = sizeof(PROPSHEETHEADER);</code>

to initialize the <b>dwSize</b> member. For earlier versions, the size of the pre-4.71 structure is given by the PROPSHEETHEADER_V1_SIZE constant. Use

<code>psh.dwSize = PROPSHEETHEADER_V1_SIZE;</code>

The PSH_WIZARD, PSH_WIZARD97, and PSH_WIZARD_LITE styles are mutually incompatible. Only one of these style flags should be set. PSH_AEROWIZARD should be combined with PSH_WIZARD.
