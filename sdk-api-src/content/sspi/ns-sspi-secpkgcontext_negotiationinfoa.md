# SecPkgContext_NegotiationInfoA structure


## -description

The <b>SecPkgContext_NegotiationInfo</b> structure contains information on the <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly">security package</a> that is being set up or has been set up, and also gives the status on the negotiation to set up the security package.

## -struct-fields

### -field PackageInfo

Pointer to a 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/sspi/ns-sspi-secpkginfoa">SecPkgInfo</a> structure that provides general information about the security package chosen in the negotiate process, such as the name and capabilities of the package.

### -field NegotiationState

Indicator of the state of the negotiation for the security package identified in the <b>PackageInfo</b> member. This attribute can be queried from the context handle before the setup is complete, such as when ISC returns SEC_I_CONTINUE_NEEDED.

The following table shows values returned in this member.

## -remarks

> [!NOTE]
> The sspi.h header defines SecPkgContext_NegotiationInfo as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
