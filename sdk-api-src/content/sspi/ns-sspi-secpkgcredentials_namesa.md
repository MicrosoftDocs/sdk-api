# SecPkgCredentials_NamesA structure


## -description

The <b>SecPkgCredentials_Names</b> structure holds the name of the user associated with a <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">context</a>. The 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/sspi/nf-sspi-querycredentialsattributesa">QueryCredentialsAttributes</a> function uses this structure.

## -struct-fields

### -field sUserName

Pointer to a null-terminated string containing the name of the user represented by the credential. If the <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly">security package</a> sets the SECPKG_FLAG_ACCEPT_WIN32_NAME flag to indicate that it can process Windows names, this name can be used in other Windows calls.

### -field sUserName.string

## -see-also

<a href="/windows/desktop/api/sspi/nf-sspi-querycredentialsattributesa">QueryCredentialsAttributes</a>

## -remarks

> [!NOTE]
> The sspi.h header defines SecPkgCredentials_Names as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
