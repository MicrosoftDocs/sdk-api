# ILayoutStorage::LayoutScript


## -description

The <b>LayoutScript</b> method provides explicit directions for reordering the storages, streams, and controls in a compound file to match the order in which they are accessed during the download.

## -parameters

### -param pStorageLayout [in]

Pointer to an array of 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/objidl/ns-objidl-storagelayout">StorageLayout</a> structures.

### -param nEntries [in]

Number of entries in the array of 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/objidl/ns-objidl-storagelayout">StorageLayout</a> structures.

### -param glfInterleavedFlag [in]

Reserved for future use.

## -returns

This function supports the standard return values E_OUTOFMEMORY, E_UNEXPECTED, E_INVALIDARG, and E_FAIL, as well as the following:

## -remarks

To provide explicit layout instructions, the application calls <b>ILayoutStorage::LayoutScript</b>, passing an array of 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/objidl/ns-objidl-storagelayout">StorageLayout</a> structures. Each structure defines a single storage or stream data block and specifies where the block is to be written in the 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-ilockbytes">ILockBytes</a> byte array.

An application can combine scripted layout with monitoring, as the structure of a particular compound file may dictate.

When the optimal data-layout pattern of an entire compound file has been determined, the application calls 
<a href="/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-ilayoutstorage-relayoutdocfile">ILayoutStorage::ReLayoutDocfile</a> to restructure the compound file to match the order in which its data sectors were accessed.
