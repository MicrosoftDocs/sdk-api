# IStorage::OpenStream


## -description


The <b>OpenStream</b> method
			 opens an existing stream object within this storage object in the specified access mode.


## -parameters




### -param pwcsName [in]

A pointer to a wide character null-terminated Unicode string that contains the name of the stream to open. The 000 through 01f characters, serving as the first character of the stream/storage name, are reserved for use by OLE. This is a compound file restriction, not a structured storage restriction.


### -param reserved1 [in]

Reserved for future use; must be <b>NULL</b>.


### -param grfMode [in]

Specifies the access mode to be assigned to the open stream. For more information and descriptions of possible values, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Stg/stgm-constants">STGM Constants</a>.  Other modes you choose must at least specify STGM_SHARE_EXCLUSIVE when calling this method in the compound file implementation.


### -param reserved2 [in]

Reserved for future use; must be zero.


### -param ppstm [out]

A pointer to 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-istream">IStream</a> pointer variable that receives the interface pointer to the newly opened stream object. If an error occurs, *<i>ppstm</i> must be set to <b>NULL</b>.


## -returns



This method can return one of these values.




## -remarks



<b>IStorage::OpenStream</b> opens an existing stream object within this storage object in the access mode specified in <i>grfMode</i>. There are restrictions on the permissions that can be given in <i>grfMode</i>. For example, the permissions on this storage object restrict the permissions on its streams. In general, access restrictions on streams need to be stricter than those on their parent storages. Compound-file streams must be opened with STGM_SHARE_EXCLUSIVE.
