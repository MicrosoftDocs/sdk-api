# MKRREDUCE enumeration


## -description


Specifies how far a moniker should be reduced.


## -enum-fields




### -field MKRREDUCE_ONE

Performs only one step of reducing the moniker. In general, the caller must have specific knowledge about the particular kind of moniker to take advantage of this option.


### -field MKRREDUCE_TOUSER

Reduces the moniker to a form that the user identifies as a persistent object. If no such point exists, then this option should be treated as MKRREDUCE_ALL.


### -field MKRREDUCE_THROUGHUSER

Reduces the moniker to where any further reduction would reduce it to a form that the user does not identify as a persistent object. Often, this is the same stage as MKRREDUCE_TOUSER.


### -field MKRREDUCE_ALL

Reduces the moniker until it is in its simplest form, that is, reduce it to itself.
