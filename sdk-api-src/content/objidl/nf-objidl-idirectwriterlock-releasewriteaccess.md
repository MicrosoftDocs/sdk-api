## -parameters






## -returns

## -remarks



The writer calls this method to release exclusive access to the storage object previously taken by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-idirectwriterlock-waitforwriteaccess">IDirectWriterLock::WaitForWriteAccess</a>.

After the writer calls this method, it is safe to allow readers to reopen the storage again until the next call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-idirectwriterlock-waitforwriteaccess">IDirectWriterLock::WaitForWriteAccess</a>.
