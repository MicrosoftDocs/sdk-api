## -parameters




### -param pStm [in]

An <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-istream">IStream</a> pointer to the stream from which the object should be loaded.


## -returns

## -remarks



This method loads an object from its associated stream. The seek pointer is set as it was in the most recent <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-ipersiststream-save">IPersistStream::Save</a> method. This method can seek and read from the stream, but cannot write to it.

<h3><a id="Notes_to_Callers"></a><a id="notes_to_callers"></a><a id="NOTES_TO_CALLERS"></a>Notes to Callers</h3>
Rather than calling <b>IPersistStream::Load</b> directly, you typically call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ole/nf-ole-oleloadfromstream">OleLoadFromStream</a> function does the following:

<ol>
<li>Calls the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/coml2api/nf-coml2api-readclassstm">ReadClassStm</a> function to get the class identifier from the stream.</li>
<li>Calls the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cocreateinstance">CoCreateInstance</a> function to create an instance of the object.</li>
<li>Queries the instance for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-ipersiststream">IPersistStream</a>.</li>
<li>Calls <b>IPersistStream::Load</b>.</li>
</ol>
The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ole/nf-ole-oleloadfromstream">OleLoadFromStream</a> function assumes that objects are stored in the stream with a class identifier followed by the object data. This storage pattern is used by the generic, composite-moniker implementation provided by OLE.

If the objects are not stored using this pattern, you must call the methods separately yourself.


<h3><a id="URL_Moniker_Notes"></a><a id="url_moniker_notes"></a><a id="URL_MONIKER_NOTES"></a>URL Moniker Notes</h3>
Initializes an URL moniker from data within a stream, usually stored there previously using its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-ipersiststream-save">IPersistStream::Save</a> (using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ole/nf-ole-olesavetostream">OleSaveToStream</a>). The binary format of the URL moniker is its URL string in Unicode (may be a full or partial URL string, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/ms775103(v=vs.85)">CreateURLMonikerEx</a> for details). This is represented as a <b>ULONG</b> count of characters followed by that many Unicode characters.
