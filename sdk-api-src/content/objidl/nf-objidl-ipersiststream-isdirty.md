# IPersistStream::IsDirty


## -description

Determines whether an object has changed since it was last saved to its stream.

## -parameters

## -returns

This method returns S_OK to indicate that the object has changed. Otherwise, it returns S_FALSE.

## -remarks

Use this method to determine whether an object should be saved before closing it. The dirty flag for an object is conditionally cleared in the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-ipersiststream-save">IPersistStream::Save</a> method.

<h3><a id="Notes_to_Callers"></a><a id="notes_to_callers"></a><a id="NOTES_TO_CALLERS"></a>Notes to Callers</h3>
You should treat any error return codes as an indication that the object has changed. Unless this method explicitly returns S_FALSE, assume that the object must be saved.

Note that the OLE-provided implementations of the <b>IPersistStream::IsDirty</b> method in the OLE-provided moniker interfaces always return S_FALSE because their internal state never changes.
