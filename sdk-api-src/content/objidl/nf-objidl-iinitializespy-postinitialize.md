# IInitializeSpy::PostInitialize


## -description


Performs initialization steps required after calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coinitializeex">CoInitializeEx</a> function.


## -parameters




### -param hrCoInit [in]

The value returned by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coinitializeex">CoInitializeEx</a>.


### -param dwCoInit [in]

The apartment type passed to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coinitializeex">CoInitializeEx</a>, specified as a member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objbase/ne-objbase-coinit">COINIT</a> enumeration.


### -param dwNewThreadAptRefs [in]

The number of times <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coinitializeex">CoInitializeEx</a> has been called on this thread.


## -returns



This method returns the value that it intends the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coinitializeex">CoInitializeEx</a> call to return to its caller. For more information, see the Remarks section.




## -remarks



The return value from <b>PostInitialize</b> is intended to be the returned <b>HRESULT</b> from the call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coinitializeex">CoInitializeEx</a>. This is always the case for a single active registration on this thread.

For cases where there are multiple registrations active on this thread, the returned <b>HRESULT</b> is arrived at by chaining of the various <b>PostInitialize</b> methods as follows: The COM determined <b>HRESULT</b> will be passed as the <i>hrCoInit</i> parameter to the first <b>PostInitialize</b> method called. The <b>HRESULT</b> from that <b>PostInitialize</b> call will be passed as the <i>hrCoInit</i> parameter to the next <b>PostInitialize</b> call. This chaining continues leading to the <b>HRESULT</b> from the last <b>PostInitialize</b> call being returned as the <b>HRESULT</b> from the call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coinitializeex">CoInitializeEx</a>.
