# ISequentialStream::Read


## -description

The <b>Read</b> method reads a specified number of bytes from the stream object into memory, starting at the current seek pointer.

## -parameters

### -param pv [out]

A pointer to the buffer which the stream data is read into.

### -param cb [in]

The number of bytes of data to read from the stream object.

### -param pcbRead [out]

A pointer to a <b>ULONG</b> variable that receives the actual number of bytes read from the stream object. 

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The number of bytes read may be zero.</div>
<div> </div>

## -returns

This method can return one of these values.

## -remarks

This method reads bytes from this stream object into memory. The stream object must be opened in <b>STGM_READ</b> mode. This method adjusts the seek pointer by the actual number of bytes read.

The number of bytes actually read is also returned in the <i>pcbRead</i> parameter.

<h3><a id="Notes_to_Callers"></a><a id="notes_to_callers"></a><a id="NOTES_TO_CALLERS"></a>Notes to Callers</h3>
The actual number of bytes read can be less than the number of bytes requested if an error occurs or if the end of the stream is reached during the read operation.  The number of bytes returned should always  be compared to the number of bytes requested.  If the number of bytes returned is less than the number of bytes requested, it usually means the <b>Read</b> method attempted to read  past the end of the stream.

The application should handle both a returned error  and <b>S_OK</b> return values on end-of-stream read operations.
