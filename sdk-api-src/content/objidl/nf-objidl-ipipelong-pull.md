# IPipeLong::Pull


## -description

Retrieves data of the long integer type from the pipe source.

## -parameters

### -param buf [out]

A pointer to the memory buffer that receives the data. The buffer must be able to hold at least the number of long integers specified in <i>cRequest</i>.

### -param cRequest [in]

The number of long integers requested.

### -param pcReturned [out]

The actual number of long integers returned.

## -returns

This method returns S_OK to indicate that the data was retrieved successfully.

## -remarks

When the <b>Pull</b> method is called, data is requested from the provider of the pipe. The caller must provide a buffer that will hold at least the number of long integers specified in the <i>cRequest</i> parameter. The proxy will unmarshal the data into the provided buffer and set the number of long integers actually provided in <i>pcReturned</i>. The <i>pcReturned</i> parameter can be less than or equal to <i>cRequest</i>, but it will never be greater. When <i>pcReturned</i> is 0, it indicates that there is no more data.
