# ILayoutStorage::EndMonitor


## -description


The <b>EndMonitor</b> method ends monitoring of a compound file. Must be preceded by a call to 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-ilayoutstorage-beginmonitor">ILayoutStorage::BeginMonitor</a>.


## -parameters






## -returns



This function supports the standard return values E_OUTOFMEMORY, E_UNEXPECTED, E_INVALIDARG, and E_FAIL, as well as all return values for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle">CloseHandle</a>.




## -remarks



A call to 
<b>EndMonitor</b> is generally followed by a call to 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-ilayoutstorage-relayoutdocfile">ILayoutStorage::RelayoutDocfile</a>, which uses the access pattern detected by the monitoring to restructure the compound file.
