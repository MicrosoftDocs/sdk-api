# IAdviseSink::OnViewChange


## -description


Notifies an object's registered advise sinks that its view has changed.


## -parameters




### -param dwAspect [in]

The aspect, or view, of the object. Contains a value taken from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wtypes/ne-wtypes-dvaspect">DVASPECT</a> enumeration.


### -param lindex [in]

The portion of the view that has changed. Currently only -1 is valid.


## -remarks



Containers register to be notified when an object's view changes by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/oleidl/nf-oleidl-iviewobject-setadvise">IViewObject::SetAdvise</a>. After it is registered, the object will call the sink's <b>IAdviseSink::OnViewChange</b> method when appropriate. <b>OnViewChange</b> can be called when the object is in either the loaded or running state.

Even though <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wtypes/ne-wtypes-dvaspect">DVASPECT</a> values are individual flag bits, <i>dwAspect</i> may represent only one value. That is, <i>dwAspect</i> cannot contain the result of an OR operation combining two or more <b>DVASPECT</b> values.

The <i>lindex</i> parameter represents the part of the aspect that is of interest. The value of <i>lindex</i> depends on the value of <i>dwAspect</i>. If <i>dwAspect</i> is either DVASPECT_THUMBNAIL or DVASPECT_ICON, <i>lindex</i> is ignored. If <i>dwAspect</i> is DVASPECT_CONTENT, <i>lindex</i> must be -1, which indicates that the entire view is of interest and is the only value that is currently valid.
