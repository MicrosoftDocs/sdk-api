# ILayoutStorage interface


## -description

The 
<b>ILayoutStorage</b> interface enables an application to optimize the layout of its compound files for efficient downloading across a slow link. The goal is to enable a browser or other application to download data in the order in which it will actually be required.

To optimize a compound file, an application  calls <a href="/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-istorage-copyto">CopyTo</a>  to layout a docfile, thus improving performance in most scenarios.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">ILayoutStorage</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>ILayoutStorage</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
