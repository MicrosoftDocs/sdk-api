# IPersistStorage::IsDirty


## -description


Determines whether an object has changed since it was last saved to its current storage.


## -parameters






## -returns



This method returns S_OK to indicate that the object has changed. Otherwise, it returns S_FALSE.




## -remarks



Use this method to determine whether an object should be saved before closing it. The dirty flag for an object is conditionally cleared in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-ipersiststorage-save">IPersistStorage::Save</a> method.

For example, you could optimize a <b>File Save</b> operation by calling the <b>IPersistStorage::IsDirty</b> method for each object and then calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-ipersiststorage-save">IPersistStorage::Save</a> method only for those objects that are dirty.

You should treat any error return codes as an indication that the object has changed. Unless this method explicitly returns S_FALSE, assume that the object must be saved.

An object with no contained objects simply checks its dirty flag to return the appropriate result.

A container with one or more contained objects must maintain an internal dirty flag that is set when any of its contained objects has changed since it was last saved.
