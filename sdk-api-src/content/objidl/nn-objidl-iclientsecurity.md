# IClientSecurity interface


## -description

Gives the client control over the security settings for each individual interface proxy of an object.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IClientSecurity</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IClientSecurity</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

Every object has one proxy manager, and every proxy manager exposes the <b>IClientSecurity</b> interface automatically. Therefore, the client can query the proxy manager of an object for <b>IClientSecurity</b>, using any interface pointer on the object. If the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-queryinterface(q)">QueryInterface</a> call succeeds, the <b>IClientSecurity</b> pointer can be used to call an <b>IClientSecurity</b> method, passing a pointer to the interface proxy that the client is interested in. If a call to <b>QueryInterface</b> for <b>IClientSecurity</b> fails, either the object is implemented in-process or it is remoted by a custom marshaler that does not support security. (A custom marshaler can support security by offering the <b>IClientSecurity</b> interface to the client.)

The interface proxies passed as parameters to <b>IClientSecurity</b> methods must be from the same object as the <b>IClientSecurity</b> interface. That is, each object has a distinct <b>IClientSecurity</b> interface; calling <b>IClientSecurity</b> on one object and passing a proxy to another object will not work. Also, you cannot pass an interface to an <b>IClientSecurity</b> method if the interface does not use a proxy. This means that interfaces implemented locally by the proxy manager cannot be passed to <b>IClientSecurity</b> methods, except for <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a>, which is the exception to this rule.
