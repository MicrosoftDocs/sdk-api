# ILockBytes interface


## -description

The 
<b>ILockBytes</b> interface is implemented on a byte array object that is backed by some physical storage, such as a disk file, global memory, or a database. It is used by a COM compound file storage object to give its root storage access to the physical device, while isolating the root storage from the details of accessing the physical storage.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">ILockBytes</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>ILockBytes</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
