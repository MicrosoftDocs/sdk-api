## -remarks

These global counters are shared variables that can help identify whether the state of a Windows component has changed over time. They can be used with these functions: <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shlwapi/nf-shlwapi-shglobalcounterdecrement">SHGlobalCounterDecrement</a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shlwapi/nf-shlwapi-shglobalcounterincrement">SHGlobalCounterIncrement</a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shlwapi/nf-shlwapi-shglobalcountergetvalue">SHGlobalCounterGetValue</a>.

<h3><a id="Example"></a><a id="example"></a><a id="EXAMPLE"></a>Example</h3>
The following pseudocode example shows how a global counter can be used.


```
void ValidateSomeSettings()
    {
        // Get the current GLOBALCOUNTER_SHELLSETTINGSCHANGED value.
        long lGlobalSettingsCounter = SHGlobalCounterGetValue(GLOBALCOUNTER_SHELLSETTINGSCHANGED);
            
        // Do some other work
        ...
    
        // Verify whether the Shell settings have changed since entering this method.
        if (lGlobalSettingsCounter == SHGlobalCounterGetValue(GLOBALCOUNTER_SHELLSETTINGSCHANGED))
        {
            // Commit the work that was done earlier 
            ...
        }
    
        else
        {
            // Shell settings have changed. Rollback and redo.
            ...
        }
    }
```
