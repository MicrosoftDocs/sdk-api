# SHOpenRegStream2A function


## -description


Opens a registry value and supplies a stream that can be used to read from or write to the value. This function supersedes <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shlwapi/nf-shlwapi-shopenregstreama">SHOpenRegStream</a>.


## -parameters




### -param hkey [in]

Type: <b>HKEY</b>

Required. The subtree, such as HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, that contains the value.


### -param pszSubkey [in, optional]

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

Optional. Pointer to a null-terminated string that specifies the subkey that contains the value. This value can be <b>NULL</b>.


### -param pszValue [in, optional]

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

Pointer to a null-terminated string that specifies the value to be accessed. This value can be <b>NULL</b>.


### -param grfMode [in]

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

The type of access for the stream. This can be one of the following values:



#### STGM_READ

Open the stream for reading.



#### STGM_WRITE

Open the stream for writing.



#### STGM_READWRITE

Open the stream for reading and writing.


## -returns



Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-istream">IStream</a>*</b>

Returns an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-istream">IStream</a> interface pointer if successful; otherwise, <b>NULL</b>. A <b>NULL</b> value can be caused by several situations, including an invalid <i>hkey</i> or <i>pszSubkey</i>, a subkey named by <i>pszSubkey</i> that does not exist, a caller without sufficient permissions to access the subkey, or an inability to open the stream.




## -remarks



The calling application is responsible for calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-release">Release</a> method of the returned object when that <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-istream">IStream</a> object is no longer needed.




> [!NOTE]
> The shlwapi.h header defines SHOpenRegStream2 as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
