# UrlCombineW function


## -description


When provided with a relative URL and its base, returns a URL in canonical form.


## -parameters




### -param pszBase [in]

Type: <b>PCTSTR</b>

A pointer to a null-terminated string of maximum length INTERNET_MAX_URL_LENGTH that contains the base URL.


### -param pszRelative [in]

Type: <b>PCTSTR</b>

A pointer to a null-terminated string of maximum length INTERNET_MAX_URL_LENGTH that contains the relative URL.


### -param pszCombined [out, optional]

Type: <b>PTSTR</b>

A pointer to a buffer that, when this function returns successfully, receives a null-terminated string that contains the combined URL.


### -param pcchCombined [in, out]

Type: <b>DWORD*</b>

A pointer to a value that, on entry, is set to the number of characters in the <i>pszCombined</i> buffer. When the function returns successfully, the value depends on whether the function is successful or returns E_POINTER. For other return values, the value of this parameter is meaningless.


### -param dwFlags

Type: <b>DWORD</b>

Flags that specify how the URL is converted to canonical form. The following flags can be combined.



#### URL_DONT_SIMPLIFY (0x08000000)

Treat '/./' and '/../' in a URL string as literal characters, not as shorthand for navigation. See Remarks for further discussion.



#### URL_ESCAPE_PERCENT (0x00001000)

Convert any occurrence of '%' to its escape sequence.



#### URL_ESCAPE_SPACES_ONLY (0x04000000)

Replace only spaces with escape sequences. This flag takes precedence over <b>URL_ESCAPE_UNSAFE</b>, but does not apply to opaque URLs.



#### URL_ESCAPE_UNSAFE (0x20000000)

Replace unsafe characters with their escape sequences. Unsafe characters are those characters that may be altered during transport across the Internet, and include the (&lt;, &gt;, ", #, {, }, |, \, ^, ~, [, ], and ') characters. This flag applies to all URLs, including opaque URLs.



#### URL_NO_META

Defined to be the same as <b>URL_DONT_SIMPLIFY</b>.



#### URL_PLUGGABLE_PROTOCOL (0x40000000)

Combine URLs with client-defined pluggable protocols, according to the W3C specification. This flag does not apply to standard protocols such as ftp, http, gopher, and so on. If this flag is set, <b>UrlCombine</b> does not simplify URLs, so there is no need to also set <b>URL_DONT_SIMPLIFY</b>.



#### URL_UNESCAPE (0x10000000)

Un-escape any escape sequences that the URLs contain, with two exceptions. The escape sequences for '?' and '#' are not un-escaped. If one of the URL_ESCAPE_XXX flags is also set, the two URLs are first un-escaped, then combined, then escaped.



#### URL_ESCAPE_AS_UTF8 (0x00040000)

<b>Windows 7 and later</b>. Percent-encode all non-ASCII characters as their UTF-8 equivalents.


##### - dwFlags.URL_DONT_SIMPLIFY (0x08000000)

Treat '/./' and '/../' in a URL string as literal characters, not as shorthand for navigation. See Remarks for further discussion.


##### - dwFlags.URL_ESCAPE_AS_UTF8 (0x00040000)

<b>Windows 7 and later</b>. Percent-encode all non-ASCII characters as their UTF-8 equivalents.


##### - dwFlags.URL_ESCAPE_PERCENT (0x00001000)

Convert any occurrence of '%' to its escape sequence.


##### - dwFlags.URL_ESCAPE_SPACES_ONLY (0x04000000)

Replace only spaces with escape sequences. This flag takes precedence over <b>URL_ESCAPE_UNSAFE</b>, but does not apply to opaque URLs.


##### - dwFlags.URL_ESCAPE_UNSAFE (0x20000000)

Replace unsafe characters with their escape sequences. Unsafe characters are those characters that may be altered during transport across the Internet, and include the (&lt;, &gt;, ", #, {, }, |, \, ^, ~, [, ], and ') characters. This flag applies to all URLs, including opaque URLs.


##### - dwFlags.URL_NO_META

Defined to be the same as <b>URL_DONT_SIMPLIFY</b>.


##### - dwFlags.URL_PLUGGABLE_PROTOCOL (0x40000000)

Combine URLs with client-defined pluggable protocols, according to the W3C specification. This flag does not apply to standard protocols such as ftp, http, gopher, and so on. If this flag is set, <b>UrlCombine</b> does not simplify URLs, so there is no need to also set <b>URL_DONT_SIMPLIFY</b>.


##### - dwFlags.URL_UNESCAPE (0x10000000)

Un-escape any escape sequences that the URLs contain, with two exceptions. The escape sequences for '?' and '#' are not un-escaped. If one of the URL_ESCAPE_XXX flags is also set, the two URLs are first un-escaped, then combined, then escaped.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

Returns standard COM error codes, including the following.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
<i>pszCombined</i> points to a string that contains the combined URLs. The value of <i>pcchCombined</i> is set to the number of characters in the string, not counting the terminating <b>NULL</b> character.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_POINTER</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The buffer was too small. The value of <i>pcchCombined</i> is set to the minimum number of characters that the buffer must be able to contain, including the terminating <b>NULL</b> character.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



Items between slashes are treated as hierarchical identifiers; the last item specifies the document itself. You must enter a slash (/) after the document name to append more items; otherwise, <b>UrlCombine</b> exchanges one document for another. For example: 		

				


```

hRetVal = UrlCombine(TEXT("http://xyz/test/abc"), 
                     TEXT("bar"), 
                     lpszCombined, 
                     &dwLength, 0);
```


The preceding code returns the URL http://xyz/test/bar. If you want the combined URL to be http://xyz/test/abc/bar, use the following call to <b>UrlCombine</b>.

				


```

hRetVal = UrlCombine(TEXT("http://xyz/test/abc/"), 
                     TEXT("bar"), 
                     lpszCombined, 
                     &dwLength, 0);
```


If a URL string contains '/../' or '/./', <b>UrlCombine</b> usually treats the characters as if they indicated navigation in the URL hierarchy. The function simplifies the URLs before combining them. For instance, "/hello/cruel/../world" is simplified to "/hello/world". If the <b>URL_DONT_SIMPLIFY</b> flag is set in <i>dwFlags</i>, the function does not simplify URLs. In this case, "/hello/cruel/../world" is left as it is.
