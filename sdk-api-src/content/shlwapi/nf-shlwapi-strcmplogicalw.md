# StrCmpLogicalW function


## -description


Compares two Unicode strings. Digits in the strings are considered as numerical content rather than text. This test is not case-sensitive.


## -parameters




### -param psz1 [in]

Type: <b>PCWSTR</b>

A pointer to the first null-terminated string to be compared.


### -param psz2 [in]

Type: <b>PCWSTR</b>

A pointer to the second null-terminated string to be compared.


## -returns



Type: <b>int</b>

<ul>
<li>Returns zero if the strings are identical.</li>
<li>Returns 1 if the string pointed to by <i>psz1</i> has a greater value than that pointed to by <i>psz2</i>.</li>
<li>Returns -1 if the string pointed to by <i>psz1</i> has a lesser value than that pointed to by <i>psz2</i>.</li>
</ul>



## -remarks



This function's ordering schema differs somewhat from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shlwapi/nf-shlwapi-strcmpiw">StrCmpI</a>, which also compares strings without regard to case sensitivity. Considering digits by their numerical value—as <b>StrCmpLogicalW</b> does—strings are ordered as follows:
		
                


```
2string
3string
20string
st2ring
st3ring
st20ring
string2
string3
string20
```


<b>StrCmpI</b> considers digits in the string only as text so that those same strings are ordered as follows:
		    
                


```
20string
2string
3string
st20ring
st2ring
st3ring
string2
string20
string3
```
