# PathBuildRootA function


## -description

Creates a root path from a given drive number.

## -parameters

### -param pszRoot [out]

Type: <b>LPTSTR</b>

A pointer to the string that receives the constructed root path. This buffer must be at least four characters in size.

### -param iDrive [in]

Type: <b>int</b>

A variable of type <b>int</b> that indicates the desired drive number. It should be between 0 and 25.

## -returns

Type: <b>LPTSTR</b>

Returns the address of the constructed root path. If the call fails for any reason (for example, an invalid drive number), <i>szRoot</i> is returned unchanged.

## -remarks

> [!NOTE]
> The shlwapi.h header defines PathBuildRoot as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
