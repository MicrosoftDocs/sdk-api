# StrSpnW function


## -description

Obtains the length of a substring within a string that consists entirely of characters contained in a specified buffer.

## -parameters

### -param psz [in]

Type: <b>PCTSTR</b>

A pointer to the null-terminated string that is to be searched.

### -param pszSet [in]

Type: <b>PCTSTR</b>

A pointer to a null-terminated character buffer that contains the set of characters for which to search.

## -returns

Type: <b>int</b>

## -remarks

> [!NOTE]
> The shlwapi.h header defines StrSpn as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
