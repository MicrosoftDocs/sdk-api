# PathIsRelativeW function


## -description

Searches a path and determines if it is relative.

## -parameters

### -param pszPath [in]

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

A pointer to a null-terminated string of maximum length MAX_PATH that contains the path to search.

## -returns

Type: <b>BOOL</b>

Returns <b>TRUE</b> if the path is relative, or <b>FALSE</b> if it is absolute.

## -remarks

> [!NOTE]
> The shlwapi.h header defines PathIsRelative as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
