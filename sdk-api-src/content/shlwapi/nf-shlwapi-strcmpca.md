# StrCmpCA function


## -description


Compares strings using C run-time (ASCII) collation rules. The comparison is case-sensitive.


## -parameters




### -param pszStr1 [out]

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

A pointer to the first null-terminated string to be compared.


### -param pszStr2 [out]

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

A pointer to the second null-terminated string to be compared.


## -returns



Type: <b>int</b>

Returns zero if the strings are identical. Returns a positive value if the string pointed to by <i>lpStr1</i> is alphabetically greater than that pointed to by <i>lpStr2</i>. Returns a negative value if the string pointed to by <i>lpStr1</i> is alphabetically less than that pointed to by <i>lpStr2</i>.




## -remarks



It is strongly recommended that you use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4db84fa7-f3c2-48fb-ad7d-8673397c4b0e">CompareString</a> function in place of this function. <b>StrCmpC</b> was designed for comparing canonical strings. These strings are not localized and consist only of characters below ASCII value 128. Therefore, it will not function correctly with a double-byte character set (DBCS) or other multiple-character data.

This function locates the first unequal characters and returns a positive number if the character from the first string is greater than the character from the second, a negative number if it is less, or zero if they are equal. For example, if <i>lpStr1</i>="abczb" and <i>lpStr2</i>="abcdefg", <b>StrCmpC</b> determines that the first unequal character is at position four ("z" in <i>lpStr1</i> and "d" in <i>lpStr2</i>) and returns a positive value since the ASCII code for "z" is greater than the ASCII code for "d".

For those versions of Windows that do not include <b>StrCmpC</b> in Shlwapi.h, this function's individual ANSI or Unicode version must be called directly from Shlwapi.dll. <b>StrCmpCA</b> is ordinal 155 and <b>StrCmpCW</b> is ordinal 156.
