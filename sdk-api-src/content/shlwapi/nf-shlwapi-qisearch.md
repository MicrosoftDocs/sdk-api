# QISearch function


## -description


A table-driven implementation of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-queryinterface(q)">IUnknown::QueryInterface</a> method.


## -parameters




### -param that [in]

Type: <b>void*</b>

A pointer to the base of a COM object.


### -param pqit [in]

Type: <b>LPCQITAB</b>

An array of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shlwapi/ns-shlwapi-qitab">QITAB</a> structures. The last structure in the array must have its <b>piid</b> member set to <b>NULL</b> and its <b>dwOffset</b> member set to 0.


### -param riid [in]

Type: <b>REFIID</b>

A reference to the IID of the interface to retrieve through <i>ppv</i>.


### -param ppv [out]

Type: <b>void**</b>

When this method returns successfully, contains the interface pointer requested in <i>riid</i>.


## -returns



Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

Returns S_OK if the requested interface was found in the table or if the requested interface was IUnknown. Returns E_NOINTERFACE if the requested interface was not found.




## -remarks



<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Prior to Windows Vista, <b>QISearch</b> was not exported by name or declared in a public header file. To use it in those cases, you must use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress">GetProcAddress</a> and request ordinal 219 from Shlwapi.dll to obtain a function pointer. Under Windows Vista, <b>QISearch</b> is included in Shlwapi.h and this is not necessary.</div>
<div> </div>
If the requested interface is IUnknown, then <b>QISearch</b> uses the first entry of the specified array of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shlwapi/ns-shlwapi-qitab">QITAB</a> structures. Otherwise, <b>QISearch</b> searches the table until it either finds a matching IID or reaches the end of the table.  If a matching IID is found, the function advances the associated interface pointer by the number of bytes specified by the <b>dwOffset</b> member of the interface's <b>QITAB</b> structure and reinterpreted as a COM pointer.  That pointer is assigned to the <b>QISearch</b> function's  <i>ppv</i> parameter. The method also calls IUnknown::AddRef to increment the interface's reference count.

If <b>QISearch</b> reaches the end of the table without finding the interface, it returns E_NOINTERFACE and sets <i>ppv</i> to <b>NULL</b>.

It is important to include all applicable interfaces in the table. For example, if the object implements a derived interface, you should also include the base interface in the table.

We recommend that you use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-iid_ppv_args">IID_PPV_ARGS</a> macro, defined in Objbase.h, to package the <i>riid</i> and <i>ppv</i> parameters. This macro provides the correct IID based on the interface pointed to by the value in <i>ppv</i>, which eliminates the possibility of a coding error in <i>riid</i> that could lead to unexpected results.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Active Template Library (ATL) provides a significantly better version of a table-driven implementation of QueryInterface.</div>
<div> </div>

#### Examples

The following example illustrates how to use <b>QISearch</b> to implement QueryInterface.  It uses the offsetofclass macro from ATL to compute the offset from the base of the CSample object to a specified interface.

This object supports two interfaces aside from IUnknown, so there are two non-<b>NULL</b> entries in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shlwapi/ns-shlwapi-qitab">QITAB</a> table. The entry for each interface specifies a pointer to the associated IID (IID_IPersist or IID_IPersistFolder) and the offset of the interface pointer relative to the class's base pointer. The sample uses the <b>offsetofclass</b> macro from ATL to determine that offset.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Forgetting to include all base classes, including indirect ones, is a common error. Notice that there is an entry for the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nn-objidl-ipersist">IPersist</a> interface. This interface is an indirect base class for CSample, inherited through <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-ipersistfolder">IPersistFolder</a>. </div>
<div> </div>

```cpp

class CSample : public IPersistFolder
{
  public:
    CSample() { /* other construction goes here */ }
    
    STDMETHODIMP QueryInterface(REFIID riid, void **ppv);
    STDMETHODIMP_(ULONG) AddRef();
    STDMETHODIMP_(ULONG) Release();
  
    // *** IPersist ***
    STDMETHODIMP GetClassID(CLSID *pClassID);
    
    // *** IPersistFolder ***
    STDMETHODIMP Initialize(LPCITEMIDLIST pidl);
  
  private:
  // private members go here
};

HRESULT CSample::QueryInterface(REFIID riid, void **ppv)
{
    static QITAB rgqit[] = 
    {   
        QITABENT(CSample, IPersist),
        QITABENT(CSample, IPersistFolder)
        { 0 },
    };

    return QISearch(this, rgqit, IID_PPV_ARGS(&ppv));
}
```
