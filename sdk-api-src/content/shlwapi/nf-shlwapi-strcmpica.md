# StrCmpICA function


## -description


Compares two strings using C run-time (ASCII) collation rules. The comparison is not case-sensitive.


## -parameters




### -param pszStr1 [in]

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

A pointer to the first null-terminated string to be compared.


### -param pszStr2 [in]

Type: <b>LPCTSTR</b>

A pointer to the second null-terminated string to be compared.


## -returns



Type: <b>int</b>

Returns zero if the strings are identical. Returns a positive value if the string pointed to by <i>lpStr1</i> is alphabetically greater than that pointed to by <i>lpStr2</i>. Returns a negative value if the string pointed to by <i>lpStr1</i> is alphabetically less than that pointed to by <i>lpStr2</i>




## -remarks



It is strongly recommended that you use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/stringapiset/nf-stringapiset-comparestringw">CompareString</a> in place of this function. <b>StrCmpIC</b> was designed for comparing canonical strings. These strings are not localized and consist only of characters below ASCII value 128. Therefore, it will not function correctly with double-byte character set (DBCS) data.

Uppercase characters are converted to lowercase characters before comparing, and the return value is based on comparing the converted values.  This function returns the difference in value of the first unequal characters it encounters, or zero if they are all equal. For example, if <i>lpStr1</i>="abczb" and <i>lpStr2</i>="abcdefg", <b>StrCmpIC</b> determines that "abczb" is greater than "abcdefg" and returns z - d.

For those versions of Windows that do not include <b>StrCmpIC</b> in Shlwapi.h, this function's individual ANSI or Unicode version must be called directly from Shlwapi.dll. <b>StrCmpICA</b> is ordinal 157 and <b>StrCmpICW</b> is ordinal 158.
