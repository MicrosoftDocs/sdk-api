## -description

Removes a resolved package dependency from the current process' package graph (that is, a run-time reference for a framework package dependency that was added by using the [AddPackageDependency](nf-appmodel-addpackagedependency.md) method).

## -parameters

### -param packageDependencyContext

Type: <b>PACKAGEDEPENDENCY_CONTEXT</b>

The handle of the package dependency to remove.

## -returns

Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If the function succeeds it returns <b>ERROR_SUCCESS</b>. Otherwise, the function returns an error code. The possible error codes include the following.

| Return code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| E_INVALIDARG | The *packageDependencyContext* parameter is NULL on input. |

## -remarks

This function does not unload loaded resources such as DLLs. After removing a package dependency, any files loaded from the package can continue
to be used. Future file resolution will fail to see the removed package dependency.
