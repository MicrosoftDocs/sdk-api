## -description

Deletes the install-time reference for the framework package dependency you created earlier by using the [TryCreatePackageDependency](nf-appmodel-trycreatepackagedependency.md) method. This method informs the OS that it is safe to remove the framework package if no other apps have a dependency on it.

## -parameters

### -param packageDependencyId

Type: <b>PCWSTR</b>

The ID of the package dependency to remove.

## -returns

| Return code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| E_INVALIDARG | The *packageDependencyId* parameter is NULL on input. |

## -remarks

Removing a package dependency is typically done when an app is uninstalled. A package dependency is implicitly removed if its lifetime artifact (specified via the *lifetimeArtifact* parameter of the [TryCreatePackageDependency](nf-appmodel-trycreatepackagedependency.md) function) is deleted. Package dependencies that are not referenced by other packages are elegible to be removed.

The caller of this function must have administrative privileges if the package dependency was created using [CreatePackageDependencyOptions_ScopeIsSystem](ne-appmodel-createpackagedependencyoptions.md).
