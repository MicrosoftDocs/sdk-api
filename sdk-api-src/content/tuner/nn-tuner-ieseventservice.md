# IESEventService interface


## -description

Implements an event service that includes methods that raise events derived from the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/tuner/nn-tuner-iesevent">IESEvent</a> interface. Media Transform Devices in a Protected Broadcast Driver Architecture (PBDA) graph can use this interface to send specific types of these events to Media Sink Devices that have registered to receive them. The <b>IESEventService</b> interface is an outgoing connection point interface.

## -inheritance

The <b>IESEventService</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IESEventService</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

To declare the interface identifier (IID) for this interface, use the <b>__uuidof</b> operator: <code>__uuidof(IESEventService)</code>.
