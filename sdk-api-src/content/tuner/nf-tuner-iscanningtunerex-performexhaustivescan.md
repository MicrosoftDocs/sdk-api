# IScanningTunerEx::PerformExhaustiveScan


## -description



This topic applies to Windows Vista and later.
        



The <b>PerformExhaustiveScan</b> method scans a range of frequencies until the tuner locks onto a signal.


## -parameters




### -param dwLowerFreq [in]

Lowest frequency in the range of frequencies to scan. A value of -1 specifies the minimum frequency as determined by the device.


### -param dwHigherFreq [in]

Highest frequency in the range of frequencies to scan. A value of -1 specifies the maximum frequency as determined by the device.


### -param bFineTune [in]

Specifies whether the tuner performs fine tuning. When the tuner locks onto a frequency, if this parameter is <b>VARIANT_TRUE</b>, the tuner does fine tuning to find the best possible signal around that frequency.


### -param hEvent [in]

Handle to an event created by the application. When the tuner locks onto a signal, it signals this event.


## -returns



Returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value. Possible values include the following.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt>S_FALSE</dt>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt>E_INVALIDARG</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Invalid frequency argument (for example, 0 <i>dwLowerFrequency</i> or <i>dwHigherFreq</i> value or <i>dwLowerFrequency</i> &gt;= <i>dwHigherFreq</i>).

</td>
