# IComponent interface


## -description

The <b>IComponent</b> interface a base class for all derived interfaces such as <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/tuner/nn-tuner-impeg2component">IMPEG2Component</a> and it describes the general characteristics of a component, which is an elementary stream within the program stream. The derived interfaces describe the properties of a component that are specific to a given network type. Component objects are created and attached to the tune request by the BDA Transport Information Filter (TIF) after reception has begun. All component objects also support <b>IPersistPropertyBag</b>.

## -inheritance

The <b>IComponent</b> interface inherits from the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oaidl/nn-oaidl-idispatch">IDispatch</a> interface. <b>IComponent</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

To declare the interface identifier (IID) for this interface, use the <b>__uuidof</b> operator: <code>__uuidof(IComponent)</code>.
