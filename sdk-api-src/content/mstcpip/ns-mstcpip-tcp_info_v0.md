# TCP_INFO_v0 structure


## -description

Contains the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)  statistics that were collected for a socket.

## -struct-fields

### -field State

A value from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mstcpip/ne-mstcpip-tcpstate">TCPSTATE</a> enumeration that indicates the  state of the TCP connection.

### -field Mss

The current maximum segment size (MSS) for the connection, in bytes.

### -field ConnectionTimeMs

The lifetime of the connection, in milliseconds.

### -field TimestampsEnabled

<b>TRUE</b> if TCP time stamps are turned on for the connection; otherwise <b>FALSE</b>.

### -field RttUs

The current estimated round-trip time for the connection, in microseconds.

### -field MinRttUs

The minimum sampled round trip time, in microseconds.

### -field BytesInFlight

The current number of sent bytes that are unacknowledged.

### -field Cwnd

The size of the current congestion window, in bytes.

### -field SndWnd

The size of the send window (SND.WND in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793">RFC 793</a>),  in bytes.

### -field RcvWnd

 The size of the receive window (RCV.WND in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793">RFC 793</a>), in bytes.

### -field RcvBuf

The size of the current receive buffer, in bytes.   The size of the receive buffer  changes dynamically when autotuning is turned on for the receive window.

### -field BytesOut

The total number of bytes sent.

### -field BytesIn

The total number of bytes received.

### -field BytesReordered

The total number of bytes reordered.

### -field BytesRetrans

The total number of bytes retransmitted.

### -field FastRetrans

The number of calls of the Fast Retransmit algorithm.

### -field DupAcksIn

The total number of duplicate acknowledgments received.

### -field TimeoutEpisodes

The total number of retransmission timeout episodes. Each episode can consist of multiple timeouts.

### -field SynRetrans

The total number of retransmitted synchronize control flags (SYNs).

## -remarks

To get an instance of this structure,  call the 
   <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl">WSAIoctl</a> or <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/network/ff566296(v=vs.85)">LPWSPIoctl</a> function with the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/mt823415(v=vs.85)">SIO_TCP_INFO</a> 
   control code.
