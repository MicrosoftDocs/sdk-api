# WAVEFILTER structure


## -description



The <b>WAVEFILTER</b> structure defines a filter for waveform-audio data. Only filter information common to all waveform-audio data filters is included in this structure. For filters that require additional information, this structure is included as the first member in another structure along with the additional information.




## -struct-fields




### -field cbStruct

Size, in bytes, of the <b>WAVEFILTER</b> structure. The size specified in this member must be large enough to contain the base <b>WAVEFILTER</b> structure.


### -field dwFilterTag

Waveform-audio filter type. Filter tags are registered with Microsoft Corporation for various filter algorithms.


### -field fdwFilter

Flags for the <b>dwFilterTag</b> member. The flags defined for this member are universal to all filters. Currently, no flags are defined.


### -field dwReserved
