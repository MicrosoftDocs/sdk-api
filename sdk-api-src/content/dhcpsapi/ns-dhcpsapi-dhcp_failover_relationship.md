## -description

The <b>DHCP_FAILOVER_RELATIONSHIP</b> structure defines information about a DHCPv4 server failover relationship.

## -struct-fields

### -field PrimaryServer

<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/dhcp/dhcp-server-management-type-definitions">DHCP_IP_ADDRESS</a> structure that contains the primary server IP address.

### -field SecondaryServer

<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/dhcp/dhcp-server-management-type-definitions">DHCP_IP_ADDRESS</a> structure that contains the secondary server IP address.

### -field Mode

<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dhcpsapi/ne-dhcpsapi-dhcp_failover_mode">DHCP_FAILOVER_MODE</a> enumeration that specifies the failover relationship mode.

### -field ServerType

<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dhcpsapi/ne-dhcpsapi-dhcp_failover_server">DHCP_FAILOVER_SERVER</a> enumeration that specifies if the server is the primary or secondary server in the failover relationship

### -field State

<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dhcpsapi/ne-dhcpsapi-fsm_state">FSM_STATE</a> enumeration that specifies the state of the failover relationship.

### -field PrevState

<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dhcpsapi/ne-dhcpsapi-fsm_state">FSM_STATE</a> enumeration that specifies the previous state of the failover relationship.

### -field Mclt

A value that specifies the Maximum Client Lead Time (MCLT) in seconds. The MCLT is the maximum time that one server can extend a lease for a client beyond the lease time known by the partner server.

### -field SafePeriod

The time, in seconds, a server will wait before transitioning from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dhcpsapi/ne-dhcpsapi-fsm_state">COMMUNICATION-INT</a> state to a <b>PARTNER-DOWN</b> state. The timer begins when the server enters the <b>COMMUNICATION-INT</b> state.

### -field RelationshipName

Pointer to a null-terminated Unicode string that represents the unique failover relationship name.

### -field PrimaryServerName

Pointer to a null-terminated Unicode string that represents the primary server hostname.

### -field SecondaryServerName

Pointer to a null-terminated Unicode string that represents the secondary server hostname.

### -field pScopes

A pointer to an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/dhcpsapi/ns-dhcpsapi-dhcp_ip_array">LPDHCP_IP_ARRAY</a> structure that contains the list of IPv4 subnet addresses that are part of the failover relationship and define its scope.

### -field Percentage

Value that specifies the ratio of the client load shared by the primary server in the failover relationship.

### -field SharedSecret

A pointer to a null-terminated Unicode string that represents the shared secret key associated with the failover relationship.
